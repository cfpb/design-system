          #### Vertical spacing


          * Applies 15px bottom margin to all `p`, `ul`, `ol`, `dl`, `figure`, `table`, and `blockquote` elements.

          * Applies -5px top `margin` to lists following paragraphs to reduce `margin between them to 10px.

          * Applies 8px bottom `margin` to list items that are not within a nav element.

          * Assumes that the font size of each of these items remains the default.


          #### Italicizing


          We don’t serve the font file for Avenir Next Italic because we found Avenir Next Regular with browser-created faux italics was an acceptable substitute, and it saves a lot of bytes not to serve it.


          #### Bolding


          We’re trying out Avenir Next Medium with faux bolding in place of Avenir Next Demi, though the results of that experiment have been less predictable, so we may yet revert that decision.
