  Links lead users to a different page or further information. In contrast,
  buttons are used to signal actions. Users should be able to identify links
  without relying on color or styling alone.

          Use icons when a link needs extra emphasis. Use icons consistently, or
          don’t use them at all. Each icon should be used exclusively for one
          action.


          Icons appear to the right of the link text. The color and font-size of
          icons should be the same as the adjacent text, including state changes.
          Icons are never underlined.

          * Styles to enable adding an icon to a link and preventing the link’s
          underline from extending under the icon.

          * For the underlined icon prevention to work, you must wrap the link text
          with a `span.icon-link_text`. There can be no whitespace between the text
          and the opening and closing `span` tags.

          * Include the icon either prior to or after the `a-link_text`. It is
          important the text and icon are siblings to correctly handle underlines.

          Warning: Icons added to inline links can sometimes break onto the next
          line. If you want to prevent this, you can add the `__no-wrap` modifier to
          `.a-link__icon`.

  **Usage**

  Links are automatically underlined when they are a child of a paragraph `p`,
  list item `li`, or definition list term `dd`:


  <p>
      <a href="#">A child of a paragraph</a>
  </p>

  <ul>
      <li>
          <a href="#">A child of a list item</a>
      </li>
  </ul>

  <dl>
      <dt>
          Definition list term
      </dt>
      <dd>
          <a href="#">A child of a definition list description</a>
      </dd>
  </dl>


  To enable them elsewhere, simply add a `border-bottom-width: 1px;` to the
  link.


  Links within a `nav` element are not underlined.



  <h3>Content guidelines</h3>


  <h3>Behavior</h3>


  Default links

  In general, links should default to opening in the same page or browser tab.
  This allows the user to choose whether they want to open an additional window
  in order to view the content.


  Opening a link in a new tab

  Links should open in a new tab in situations where users enter data or make
  selections that would be lost if they left the page. This includes interactive
  tools, search filters, and forms where the user has to enter and submit
  information.


  Add `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"` to direct these links to
  securely open in a new tab.


  Add an `aria-label` that includes the link text and informs users with visual
  impairments that the link will open in a new tab. An example would be
  `aria-label="Learn why some county data are unavailable. (Link opens in new
  tab.)"` This meets [WCAG guideline 3.2 that webpages should work in a
  predictable way](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G201.html).
