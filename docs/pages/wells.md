    variation_group_name: Standard well
use_cases: >-
  Grey wells should be used to feature content or specific calls to action.
  They  will help visually set apart the content within it, so use sparingly to
  draw attention to that content. 


  Ideally, content within a well should not take up more than a third of page content.
content_guidelines: >-
  Text, images, and embedded media (like video) may be placed within wells,
  however, if content includes imagery, also consider the [Featured Content
  Module](/design-system/components/featured-content-module). Examples of types
  of content to include: 


  * Headings (H2 - H5). Headings should be as succinct as possible and 35 characters or less (including spaces)

  * Text (including bullets and numbered lists). Text should be succinct. 

  * Links
behavior: >-
  Wells are full width. Note that at breakpoints 600 and under there are slight
  padding adjustments to maximize real estate on smaller displays.
