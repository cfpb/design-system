  Illustrations are an important tool for introducing the subject matter of a
  page, event, or topic. Illustrations are vector-based graphics that support
  primary headers and text. They function as the brand’s top-level illustration
  style with detail and clarity. Illustration is universally relatable and
  accessible to all audiences. The content of an illustration should always be
  politically and socially neutral.

      These illustrations should feature flat elements and avoid showing things
      in three dimensions. Elements should not appear to be outlined.

      Top-facing illustrations are object-based. Illustrations should be
      arranged in a way that it appears the viewer is immersed in a real life
      scenario. These should include 4-6 objects and relative sizing to create a
      realistic and natural perspective. Shadows around objects can be used to
      create realism in top-facing perspective. If using top-facing perspective
      in a project, all illustrations should maintain that perspective for
      consistency.

usage: >-
  Illustrations are universally relatable and set a friendly tone when
  communicating complex topics.


  The color palette should use the full range of primary and secondary colors,
  but selectively use a maximum of 3-4 colors, using midtones and tints to
  differentiate components. Illustrations should also make use of 100% white and
  black.


  #### Composition


  All illustrations should have relative sizing when more than one object is
  included. Illustrations should appear natural, but stylized. Do not scale-up
  or collage minicons or isocons for use in illustrations. Minicons can be used
  as graphic details when scaled appropriately.


  Illustrations should be compositionally balanced with related headers and
  text. Reduce “floating” by bleeding illustrations off the edges of the
  graphic. Make use of layering and subtle, vector-based background patterns to
  help ground the illustration. Shadows are appropriate when objects overlap but
  should not extend outside of objects.


  Do not use negative space to define outlines.

  #### Form


  All illustrations should be based on commonly used geometric shapes like
  circles, triangles, beams, and rectangles.


  To stylize illustrations according to CFPB standards, use relative sizing on
  stroke weights with a rounded end cap. For curved lines, the stylized stroke
  is recommended throughout illustrations.

  #### Shading and highlights


  Objects should be lit from the upper-left side. This is consistent with the
  beam in our logo. The overall placement of highlights and shading should be
  carefully decided by the designer and consistent throughout the project.


  Shading should be achieved using subtle, solid tints, not gradients, textures,
  multiply, or blurs.


  There are two types of highlights available for illustrations; curved and
  diagonal. The curved highlight is recommended when the object is round.
  Diagonal highlights are mostly used in rectangular objects. They are also
  frequently used to show reflections. To create a diagonal highlight, a tint of
  the background color is cast from the top-right corner of an object at a 45º
  angle.

  #### Shadows


  Shadows are created using a darker tint of the background color. They are
  appropriate when objects overlap but should not extend outside of objects. In
  top-facing illustrations, shadows around objects can be used to create
  realism.


  The overall placement of shadows should be carefully decided by the designer
  and consistent throughout the project.

  #### Include text alternatives for non-text content


  For any content that is not text-based (images, audio, video, animations,
  charts, graphs, etc), provide an alternative version of that content that is
  text-based.

  * Use the `alt` and `title` attributes on images and other graphical elements.

  * Use the `<title>` and `<desc>` elements in SVG drawings.

  * Include descriptive text near images (for example, a pie chart legend with
  percentages of each item).
