          text, for example email addresses, names, or search queries. The

          input, so that the user can see what they've typed without having to
          scroll to reveal hidden content.

  ### Stylistic guidelines


  Choose the appropriate width for text input fields so they match the kind of information requested. This makes it easier for users to quickly grasp what’s being asked.


  For example, it’s hard to understand at a glance that a single 1,000 px-wide text field is asking for your phone number or birth date. When possible, be even more explicit with the width by dividing it into known character counts. For instance, social security number should be three characters, then two, then four. Be mindful of not getting too restrictive, however. This approach could work for phone numbers, but only if international numbers are not permitted.


  These types of inputs should always be smaller widths:


  * Middle initial

  * Date, month, or year

  * State abbreviation


  ### Content guidelines


  Text should be in sentence case. Use placeholder text for formatting examples only. Don’t use for instructions. Placeholder text disappears once a user begins typing in the field. For more information, see [Design System guidance on placeholder text](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/components/helper-text#placeholder-text-1).
eyebrow: Components
title: Text inputs
description: Text inputs allow the user to enter any combination of letters,
  numbers, or symbols. Text input fields can span single or multiple lines.
use_cases: ""
behavior: As the screen size gets smaller, break multi-column inputs into a
  single, stacked column. Fields that are next to each other on a large screen,
  should stack at smaller screen sizes. When possible, fields should span the
  entire width of the screen at the smallest screen sizes.
accessibility: >-
  Inputs should always be paired with a `label` for accessibility reasons.


  Users of screen readers use the tab key to move focus from one form control to another. Make sure that tab focus order reflects the way you would like users to navigate through the form. Consider whether tabs should move a user down or across the page.
