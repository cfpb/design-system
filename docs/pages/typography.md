description: A clear typographic hierarchy is critical to the effective
  communication of our brand. Type should be light and well-spaced to reinforce
  that we are transparent, open, and approachable. This system uses weight,
  scale, and capitalization to convey the relative importance of each heading
  within a document. Readability and accessibility allow all users to
  efficiently read and absorb textual information.

  Readable text allows users to efficiently read and take in textual
  information. Text that is not readable turns off readers or makes it
  challenging for them to stay focused. The following guidelines promote good
  readability.


  #### Alignment


  Typography should be set flush left. This provides the eye a constant starting point for each line, making text easier to read.


  ![Alignment](/design-system/images/uploads/alignment.png)


  #### Line height


  Ample space between lines of type promotes an open feeling and lends flow to body copy. When setting body copy, the leading should be 1.375 times the type size, or 37.5% larger.


  ![Line height](/design-system/images/uploads/line_height.png)


  #### Line length


  Comfortable line length allows the user’s eyes to flow easily from the end of one line to the beginning of the next.


  For a single column of text, line length should be an average of 66 characters per line, including spaces, but may range from 50 to 75 characters.

  #### Spacing


  White space affects how the user focuses their attention on the content. It makes it easier to know what to read and where to begin. Spacing between typographic elements should be open enough to feel light, but close enough to establish a proper relationship between elements.


  ##### Heading followed by body copy


  When a heading is followed by paragraph text, include 30px of space below Display and 15px below Headings 1–6.

  ##### Body copy followed by a heading


  When body copy is followed by a heading, include 45px of space above Heading 2 and 30px above Headings 3–6.

  ##### Heading followed by a heading


  For stacked headings, include 30 px of space after the primary heading.

  ##### Body copy spacing


  For multiple paragraphs within the same section set the space between paragraphs to 15px.

  #### Text contrast


  WCA (Web Content Accessibility) standards ensure that content is accessible by everyone, regardless of any disability or user device.


  To ensure text remains compliant with [WCAG 2.0 standards](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/), use only these permitted color combinations. These options fall within the range of foreground/background color contrast permitted by the Section 508 guidelines.
