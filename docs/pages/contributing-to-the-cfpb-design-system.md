description: The [Design System](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/) (DS) is
  an open-source resource for designing and developing at the CFPB. It’s
  intended to help teams produce consistent, effective and accessible products
  for the American public, and it holds the code and design specs we want to
  encourage the use of.
