The flexible design adjusts for different devices.\n\nInformation about Grid can be found at:\n\n* <http://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/global-elements/grid.html>\n* <https://cfpb.github.io/capital-framework/components/cf-grid/>\n\n**Warning:** _This document is written for people who might want to create a grid system using our Less mixins, and does not itself document how we have used our own mixins to create a grid system. Nor does it document how to use said grid system. This page probably needs a major re-write._\n\n----\n\nThe grid component is a suite of Less variable and mixins that enables you to\nlay out a flexible 12-column grid with fixed-size gutters.\n(Column widths will expand and contract with the width of the page,\nbut the gutter width remains constant.)\nThe mixins are made to be used within your project's Less code to give grid\nlayout to your content without needing to use non-semantic grid classes.\n\nFor example, when creating a half-and-half layout, instead of applying classes\nto your column wrappers, like this:\n\n```\n<div class=\"col-half\"> … </div>\n<div class=\"col-half\"> … </div>\n```\n\nYou can give your wrappers semantic class names that describe their content,\nand apply the mixins to those semantic classes, like this:\n\n```\n<div class=\"description\"> … </div>\n<div class=\"illustration\"> … </div>\n```\n\n```\n.description,\n.illustration {\n    .grid_column(1, 2);\n}\n```\n\nRead on for more details on the variables and mixins this component provides.\n\n> NOTE: If you use `cf-grid.less` directly,\n>   be sure to run the file through\n>   [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer),\n>   or your compiled Capital Framework CSS will\n>   not work perfectly in older browsers.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"docs/components/grid.md","sha":"51beeb166e30c36a3fb79ba382aed08d37dfac50"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2019-09-10T15:06:09.986Z"}
