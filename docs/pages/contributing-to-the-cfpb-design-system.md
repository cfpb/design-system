description: The [Design System](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/) (DS) is
  an open-source resource for designing and developing at the CFPB. It’s
  intended to help teams produce consistent, effective and accessible products
  for the American public, and it holds the code and design specs we want to
  encourage the use of.

      Changes can be suggested by visiting the CFPB Design System

      public GitHub repo and creating a [website documentation

      change issue](https://github.com/cfpb/design-system/issues). 


      The GItHub issue will have some additional information for you to

      supply. Be sure to include what content you would like to see changed and

      what page(s) would be affected, what your reason for the changes or additions are,

      and any relevant data or research you may have that would necessitate or

      support the change.
  - variation_group_name: Component change or addition request
    variations: []
    variation_group_description: >-
      If you would like to see an update or change

      to an existing component or a new component please visit the CFPB Design System public GitHub repository and create a [component change/addition issue](https://github.com/cfpb/design-system/issues). The issue will have some additional

      information for you to include. 


      Before filling out the information be sure that you can answer “**yes**” to one of the following questions:


      ### Existing components:


      * Is the proposed change due to any accessibility or usability issue with the existing component?

      * Does the change alter the existing component in only one major way (e.g. color change)? If so, consider if it should be a variation of the existing component rather than a replacement.


      ### Adding a new component:


      * Is the proposed component currently being used on more than one page type on www.consumerfinance.gov? Alternatively, can you provide examples of multiple places where the proposed component could be used?

      * Are existing Design System components not sufficiently able to serve your product or users’ needs, thus requiring the need to create a new component?

      * Is the proposed component different in more than one major way from existing components in the Design System? If the proposed component is different from an existing component in only one way (e.g. color), it would likely be better to add it as a variant of the existing component. 


      If you were able to answer **“yes”** to any of the above questions the next steps are to prepare your change for review by adding the following information to the GitHub issue. 


      ### GitHub issue details:


      *For component update or new additions, please be sure to include the following:*


      * Indicate if your change request  is for making a change to an existing component or for adding a new one to the Design System

      * Add any data or research you have to show that the proposed change is accessible and usable

      * Supply any design and development context for your request (e.g. Figma concepts, code samples, etc)

      * Include if you can design and build the proposed change or if you will need to request that someone make the changes for you

      * Draft documentation for the proposed change to be included in the Design System website (can be included in the issue or as a comment)
  - variation_group_name: After change request creation and submission
    variation_group_description: Submitting the request via GitHub issue will
      trigger a review of the proposed change from at least one member of each
      discipline responsible for supporting the Design System. Communication
      about your change request will be handled via the GitHub issue in our
      Design System public GitHub repository.
