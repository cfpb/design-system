guidelines: Tooltips should be activated by hovering or focusing over a help
  (question mark) icon that is next to text that requires additional clarity.
  They contain standard size body text and an optional `h3` heading.
eyebrow: Components
behavior: Pressing the `esc` key should dismiss all open tooltips. When a
  tooltip is at the edge of the user's viewport, it should automatically
  reorient itself away from the edge of the screen to prevent content clipping.
accessibility: >-
  Tooltips are progressive enhancements for the `title` attribute, and will
  display as the `title` attribute if the component doesnâ€™t initialize.


  When testing tooltips for accessibility, ensure they are compliant with [USWDS' guidelines](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/tooltip/accessibility-tests/).
