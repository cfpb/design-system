  Motion graphics are the combination of graphic design, animation, and visual
  effects. They can be used to tell an engaging story and communicate a message,
  making complex ideas simpler and easier to understand. The CFPB uses motion
  graphics to bring illustrations to life with movement and sound design.


  All CFPB motion graphics should adhere to the design guidelines laid out in the design system page and should remain visually consistent with the CFPB brand. This includes color palette, fonts, and illustration style.  


  If an illustration from the library is not divided into labeled layers within Illustrator, the motion graphics designer will need to edit the Illustrator file and prep it for After Effects.


  Animations should be at a minimum of 1920x1080 with a frame rate of 29.97 FPS unless otherwise specified.

    variation_group_description: >-
      The CFPB uses a 2.5D style of animation. Illustrations are flat with an
      illusion of depth and can move on the X, Y, and Z axis. All animation is
      done within After Effects. The CFPB does not use Cinema 4D or any 3D
      animation software. 


      Motion should always be fluid, flowing, and constant. There should be no still frames. Every frame should have movement. When possible, elements should animate on and off, rather than cut in and out.


      Depth is created by layering elements, offsetting the animation of elements, depth of field, and shadow built into the illustration. Drop shadow should be used sparingly and should not be used on text.

    variation_group_description: "**Motion blur** is the blur effect that happens
      from movement. Motion blur should always be turned on with few exceptions.
      The CFPB uses motion blur to create more fluid and natural movement."
  - variation_group_name: Sound Design
    variation_group_description: >-
      Sound is an important part of motion graphics. There are three key
      components of sound in most of the CFPB’s motion graphics videos:


       


      <!--\[if !supportLists]-->1.    <!--\[endif]-->Voiceover


       


      <!--\[if !supportLists]-->2.    <!--\[endif]-->Sound effects


       


      <!--\[if !supportLists]-->3.    <!--\[endif]-->Music


       


      Voiceover provides narration. Sound effects bring scenes to life, while music helps set the tone and pacing.
