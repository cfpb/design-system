  Landing page types provide an overview of a main navigation section and helps
  users situate themselves within the site and the subject matter. Their main
  function is to preview the different sub-pages within that section and help
  users quickly skim section topics and select the category that interests them.

  #### Use cases


  ##### When to use


  * The landing page template should only be used for the top-level page under
  each main navigation section on the site to help users navigate to the various
  sub-sections within the navigation vertical. Examples: [Data & research
  overview](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/), [Policy &
  compliance overview](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/policy-compliance/).

  * This template may also be used for campaign pages.


  ##### When other options are better


  * When a new page is needed within a navigation section, rather than at the
  top-level.

  * When page content includes paragraph copy or more detailed definitions or
  explanations.


  #### Content guidelines


  * Generally, content components should work together to provide an overview of
  the information organized below this page or about the campaign. Give users
  clear next steps and calls to actions so they can quickly decide what content
  is relevant to them and where they should go next.

  * This page should be written and organized in a way that aids the user in
  skimming and quickly navigating to lower-level pages.

  * Page titles are sentence case and use the word “and” instead of “&”. (Note
  that navigation labels follow a different style.)

  * Email signup component should only be used on campaign landing pages. This
  component is not used on Landing pages.


  ##### Area 1: Introduction


  * Choose between a [hero](/design-system/components/heroes) or [text
  introduction](/design-system/components/introductions) for this area.


  ##### Area 2: Main content


  * Must contain at least 1 component.

  * Recommended hierarchy of components: [image &
  text](/design-system/components/info-unit-groups-image-and-text) components,
  [gray well](/design-system/components/wells), and [half width link
  blobs](/design-system/components/info-unit-groups-link-blobs).

  * The [gray well](/design-system/components/wells) component should not be
  used at the top of this area if the introduction area contains a hero.


  ##### Area 3: Sidebar


  * Must contain at least 1 component.

  * If using both static and dynamic content, preference for dynamic content to
  appear above static content.


  #### Behavior


  Below the 901 pixel breakpoint, the sidebar stacks below the main content
  area.


  ##### Breakpoints 901 pixels or more
