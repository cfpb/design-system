{"type":"PR","pr":{"number":234,"head":"c0ec62cf04a5603e75360ece545b71329c287089"},"user":"George Kokkinidis","status":"draft","branch":"cms/featured-content-modules","collection":"components","title":"Featured Content Module","description":"Featured content modules (FCMs) highlight a specific piece of content at the top of a page. It’s meant to call attention to a related piece of content that might be new or otherwise relevant to—but not directly a part of—the main content on the page, the primary intended user action, or the user journey.\n\n\n\nThe goal of the FCM is to have the user do one of three things: learn something (usually by navigating to other content), watch something, or download something (a printable tool or resource). Because this content is being featured temporarily, and not meant to be permanent, it shouldn’t be seen as integral to the page, meaning the content could be changed or removed from the page without taking away vital information the user needs or interrupting the user journey. Therefore, this module is not intended to support the site IA as the primary, permanent location for content.\n\n\n\nFCMs appear below the title and introductory paragraph on a page, and retain that position on all screen sizes. FCMs can appear on any page type, though they are best suited for pages third level and below in the site map. They are designed to accommodate pages with either a left-hand navigation or right-hand sidebar.\n\n\n\nInformation about Featured Content Modules can be found at:\\\n\n\\* http://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/page-components/featured-content-module.html\\\n\n\\* https://cfpb.github.io/capital-framework/components/cf-layout/#featured-content-module","objects":{"entry":{"path":"docs/components/featured-content-modules.md","sha":"41cf009e43b78f3c54afeb7edf3a94743d4050da"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2019-08-15T15:40:28.814Z"}
