description: >-
  Capital Framework is a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript patterns by the
  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with the following goals: consolidate
  front-end code patterns across CFPB web products in a collaborative way,
  adhere to design and UX standards set forth by the CFPB Design Manual, respect
  the guiding principles of accessibility, and support a wide range of browsers.

  As a work of the United States government, all code is open source and in the
  public domain (excluding any exceptions listed within in the project’s
  TERMS.md file). We encourage you to use this framework in your own projects
  and to contribute back.

  #### Browser support & testing

  We actively test Capital Framework components in the following browsers:  

    - Chrome  
    - Firefox  
    - Safari  
    - Edge  
    - IE 8+  
    - Safari on iOS  
    - Chrome for Android  

  #### Accessibility

  We deeply value accessible web products and work to ensure that all of our
  components comply with Section 508 rules for creating accessible software and
  websites. We actively test components to ensure that they are keyboard and
  screen reader friendly.

  #### A NOTE ABOUT OUR STANDARDS

  These standards reflect our latest thinking and are just beginning to be
  incorporated into the CFPB's most recent projects. See these standards in
  practice in eRegs, Consumer Response, and HMDA.
