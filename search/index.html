They should serve as the backbone for the user experience, ensuring that the standards we set enable products that are easy to use and understand for consumers.Public service, public trustHonest, transparent design that wins the public’s trust.We establish trust through clear, concise, and approachable design that is always consumer-driven. We demonstrate transparency through our user-friendly online experiences and tools and our dedication to open-source content.Give the user controlDesign to empower users with information.The CFPB motivates consumers to take the control of their financial decision-making; our designs enable this process. Good design increases transparency and succinctly hands the user all the necessary information, giving consumers control of how they use it. Designers must rely on introspection and research to discover what path users instinctively take and then cater to those instincts.Aesthetic integrityAlign appearance with purpose.Aesthetic integrity is not merely “attractiveness;” it implies the successful integration of design and function. Appearance should align with purpose. Using clear and intuitive design creates a trustworthy tone and a powerful platform for supporting the CFPB’s mission.Maintain consistency and clarity.Maintaining consistency in design empowers users to seamlessly transfer their knowledge and skills from one product to another. Focusing on consistency helps uphold aesthetic integrity.Design with dataDesign gives voice to data, and data informs design.Because the CFPB is a data-driven organization, quantitative measures of success should be integral to the design process. Design should incorporate data to aid understanding of complex issues, and data-driven feedback should influence the design process. Succinct and compelling visualization of information gives data a voice and helps us clarify otherwise indigestible numbers.Inclusion and accessibilityDesign for the widest possible demographic with bias toward clear articulation, plain language, and intuitive design.We design to meet each consumer where he or she is. We are sensitive to experiential level, timing, and biases and aim to design experiences that are equally accessible to everyone, and equally empowering no matter what the user’s skill set or familiarity. Simple, clean designs are the most effective and wide-reaching.Coherent end-to-end user experienceUnify parts of the user experience and transition seamlessly between them.The best design guides the user’s experience from beginning-to-end and caters to his or her expectations. Navigation between sections should be intuitive and transitions should be seamless. Consistent quality and attention to detail are essential to maintain a cohesive user experience.",

For example, if you want to add a new component page, make sure you’re in the “Components” section.  Click the “+ Add new page” button at the bottom of the page.  If you haven’t already, log in to our CFPB GitHub repo.  Fill out the relevant fields of the CMS that appear on the left, a preview of your page will appear on the right. You can edit the fields on the left as needed. The rich text field will let you easily style the text, but you can use additional markdown as needed to create the page content you want.  Click “Save” at the top of the screen to save your work. Netlify will create a pull request in our public GitHub repo: https://github.com/cfpb/design-system/pulls.  Your work will not be visible until your pull request has been approved and merged.Editing pages  Navigate to the page you’d like to edit.  At the bottom of the page, click the “Edit this page” button that has a pencil icon.  If you haven’t already, log in to our CFPB GitHub repo.The left side of your screen will show the CMS fields, the right side shows a preview of the page.

Select an image from the current library or upload a new image from your computer. Note: Due to a bug in Netlify CMS, the image might not immediately appear in the preview pane.Updating navigationChange a page’s location in the side navigation by changing the “Navigation Section” field in the CMS.Updating design tokensCFPB’s design tokens are stored in a spreadsheet located in the repository’s /docs/_data folder. You can add new tokens and change existing ones by editing the file in your favorite spreadsheet software.To add a spec to a component variation’s specs tables, add the applicable component variation to column A. Use the format &lt;component-name&gt;_&lt;variation-name&gt;. For example, to add the Button background spec in the above screenshot to the first variation on the buttons component page, you would add buttons_primary-button to the row’s first cell.Column B is the human-readable name of the specification and column C is the machine-readable name of the specification (we use Less variables). The value of the specification can be added to column D. This will often be another Less variable.Columns E - M are the specifications’ values. Complete only the applicable columns. For example, our headings (h1, h2, etc.) only have Pixels and Points defined because they’re the only things needed to size a heading (pixels for websites and points for print documents). The Second and color columns are blank because time and colors don’t concern headings.",

            'title': 'Accessibility',
            'description': "The following four principles, as defined by the W3C®, lay the foundation for ensuring that web content is available for all users, including users with disabilities and users on non-desktop devices. They also enable future compatibility in the event that future devices are radically different from those in use today.  Perceivable  Operable  Understandable  RobustNote: While this document can function as a checklist – and at times, it will – that isn’t the primary purpose. The goal is to foster understanding of why these guidelines are important.This guide is adapted from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, a W3C Recommendation. More info.Perceivable(View on W3C site)Information and user interface elements must be presented to users in ways that they can perceive. This includes considering individuals using assistive technology (e.g., screen readers for blind users or captions for deaf users) and the limitations of different devices (e.g., grayscale screens or muted mobile devices).Include text alternatives for non-text contentFor any content that is not text-based (images, audio, video, animations, charts, graphs, etc), provide an alternative version of that content that is text-based.  Use the alt and title attributes on images and other graphical elements.  Use the &lt;title&gt; and &lt;desc&gt; elements in SVG drawings.  Use fallback text for the &lt;object&gt; element.  Include descriptive text near images (for example, a pie chart legend with percentages of each item).  Provide transcripts of audio and video recordings.  Provide alternatives for multimedia  Multimedia such as audio, video, and animations will usually require more than just descriptive text. In most cases, the timing of text and descriptions in these files is important and should therefore be incorporated in an accessible manner.Prerecorded content  For audio-only content, provide a transcript of both spoken words and descriptions of other sounds.  For video-only content, provide an audio track or transcript that describes the video.  Combined audio and video content should accommodate alternatives for both (e.g., closed captioning or sign interpretation for audio, and an audio track or a screenplay-like document that transcribes dialog and descriptions of sounds and action for video).Live content  Closed captioning or sign language interpretation should always be available, but in some cases providing the prepared remarks or script alongside the audio/video may suffice.Organize content semanticallySemantic content allows user agents to correctly parse documents and present it to end users in a way that is appropriate for their device and medium without losing information or structure.  Use semantic HTML, including relative header tags, lists, and semantic tags like &lt;aside&gt;, and &lt;figure&gt;  Support HTML tables with semantic tags like &lt;th&gt;, &lt;thead&gt;, &lt;tbody&gt;, and &lt;caption&gt;  Mark up HTML forms with semantic tags like &lt;label&gt;, &lt;fieldset&gt;, &lt;legend&gt;, and – where appropriate – HTML5 form additions like email fields.  If the sequence of a page matters, the underlying HTML document should be in that order or the sequence should be machine-readable through another method.  Avoid text descriptions that rely on layout or other sensory items such as “click the round button” or “the image on the right.” However, note that “above” and “below” are generally understood to mean “preceding” and “after,” and as such are permissible usage.Make content easily distinguishable from its surroundingsThese guidelines help ensure that content is perceivable for sighted users.Text  Choose easy-to-read fonts.  Avoid using images of text, except for logos and images meant to represent physical documents.  Text should be able to be resized up to 200% without causing overlapping issues with other content on the page. Don’t rely on browser zoom, since some users have settings to force large type.Color  Do not use color as the only means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.  Text should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5 : 1, but there are exceptions.          For large text, a contrast ratio of only 3 : 1 is necessary. Large regular text is at least 18pt/24px, while large bold text is 14pt/18px.      Text or images of text that are either pure decoration or not visible, or are part of a logo, picture that contains significant other visual content, or inactive UI components (like disabled form controls) do not have a color contrast requirement.        The Color Contrast Checker is a good tool for testing color contrast ratios.Audio  Avoid auto-playing audio. If this is absolutely unavoidable, provide a control that allows the user to stop the audio and adjust or mute the volume.  In recorded audio, background sounds should be at least 20 dB lower than foreground sounds and speech. This does not apply to music.Operable(view on W3C site)User interface components and navigation must be operable: an interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform. Following these guidelines will guarantee that all users can navigate a website or app regardless of their input device (mouse, keyboard, touchscreen, screen reader, etc).Ensure that all content is keyboard accessibleIn general, if a website can be operated using only the keyboard, it will also be operable with less-common input devices.  All controls must be addressable by the keyboard. By default, this includes &lt;a&gt;, &lt;area&gt;, &lt;object&gt;, and all form elements. Other elements can be made addressable by applying a tabindex value.  Avoid keyboard traps. If a user can tab to an element on the page, the user needs to be able to exit that element using only the keyboard as well.  Do not rely on specific timing of individual keystrokes when implementing keyboard accessibility.Give users ample time to interact with contentYou should not use time limits. For cases in which time limits are unavoidable:  Allow users to turn off or extend the time limit to at least 10 times the default setting.  Warn users at least 20 seconds before a time limit expires and enable a time extension with a simple action, such as pressing the space bar.  If a user needs to log in again after a time limit, make sure that there is no loss of data.Avoid interrupting users  Avoid popups or other modal dialogs that haven not been prompted by explicit user action or are alerting the user about something that is time-sensitive.  Allow users to pause, stop, or hide anything moving, blinking, or scrolling on the screen if the motion lasts longer than 5 seconds.  Allow users to pause, stop, hide, or control the frequency of auto-updating information.Do not create designs or interactions that may cause seizuresNothing on the page should flash more than 3 times in 1 second.Help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are  Allow users to bypass blocks of content that appear repeatedly on a website, like navigation, with a “skip to main content” or similar link.  Use titles that describe a webpage’s topic or purpose.  Include descriptive section headings to organize content.  Unless content is a step in a process, provide more than one way to access it, such as through browsing and search.  Provide a breadcrumb trail or other way for the user to identify their location in the site on every page.  Use descriptive link text. Avoid calls to action like “click here” or “read more.”Manage focusWhen users navigate a webpage using the keyboard or another alternative input device, only one element on the page will be in focus at a given time.  If the order of controls on a page matters, make sure they will be focused in that order when navigating by keyboard.  Make sure there is a visible indicator on screen of which element has focus. This may be an optional mode, but it should be turned on if the user begins to navigate with the keyboard.  If a user action causes a modal dialog to appear on screen, make sure the focus is moved to that dialog or area. When the dialog is dismissed, re-focus back to the original control or to some other logical place in the document.Understandable(view on W3C site)Users must be able to comprehend content and how to operate an interface.Create text content that is machine- and human-readable  Specify the language of the content in a machine-readable way. Generally, this means using &lt;html lang=\"en-us\"&gt; or the equivalent for another language. This will help with translation software and ensures that screen readers will use the correct pronunciation.  If part of a document is in a different language from the overall language of the document, specify this with something like &lt;span lang=\"fr\"&gt;.  Where possible, provide a way for users to find definitions of unusual words and phrases, especially jargon.  Make the meaning of abbreviations and acronyms available, either directly in the text, such as “Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)”, or in a machine-readable way, like &lt;abbr title=\"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\"&gt;CFPB&lt;/abbr&gt;).  Write text to an eighth-grade comprehension level, excluding proper names and titles, where possible. If that is not an option, provide a simplified version of the text nearby.  For hard-to-pronounce words, consider including the pronunciation.Develop sites that behave in a predictable way  Related webpages should have a consistent navigation structure and layout.  Components that perform the same action should be labelled the same way.Maintain contextAvoid changing a user’s context without an explicit request from the user, like clicking a button. If an automatic context change is necessary, warn the user in advance, and give them an opportunity to stop it.A few examples of context changes:  Submitting a form  Moving focus to a different element  Popping open a help dialog box  Launching a new window  Following a link  Reloading most of the content on a pageRobust(View on W3C site)Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. A robust site will be broadly compatible with past, current, and future web browsers and devices.Follow standard web best practicesThis means using standard HTML markup. If complex widgets are required, use WAI-ARIA to make the use, states, and properties clear to browsers and assistive technologies.  Make sure your HTML validates.  Use unique IDs on individual pages.  Avoid deprecated or proprietary markup.  Make sure states and properties of elements are machine readable.Note that this is specific to HTML and does not include CSS.",

Using transparency increases the strength of the beam metaphor. Transparency should be achieved through opacity, not blending modes like multiply / darken / etc.  Composition Beam patterns are composed of overlapping beams that frame areas of white space used for titles, text, and other graphic elements. Beams always point horizontally, not vertically.  Ideal composition  Solid green beam bleeds off the top of the layout. Beams alternate direction to create layered beam shapes.    Ideal composition  Layered beams anchor to the bottom, leaving plenty of white space above for type. This works especially well for horizontal layouts.    {% include icons/error-round.svg %} Poor composition  Beams float in white space, leaving little room for content.

By submitting a pull request or filing a bug, issue, or feature request, you are agreeing to comply with this waiver of copyright interest. Details can be found in our TERMS and LICENSE.Using the issue trackerUse the issue tracker to suggest feature requests, report bugs, and ask questions—or use it to find ways to contribute, by finding a bug or a feature. If you[ll contribute, make a comment in the issue, then follow the Changing the codebase guidance below.Changing the codebaseWe work off feature branches from the master branch. After you’ve edited a component, open a Pull Request to merge your feature branch back into master.Sample workflowFor example, if you wanted to change @cfpb/cfpb-buttons and use it in cfgov-refresh, here’s what you’d do:  git clone git@github.com:cfpb/design-system.git, if you haven’t already.  cd design-system  git checkout master &amp;&amp; git pull to ensure you’re on the latest changes (this step is not necessary when cloning for the first time).  yarn to install dependencies and set up workspaces  git checkout -b button-fix to create a new branch for your changes.  Edit file(s) in /packages/buttons/ however you want.  yarn run design-system-link to link your local CF components.  cd ~/wherever/cfgov-refresh/ to navigate to another project where you’d like to test your buttons changes (in this case, cfgov-refresh).  yarn link @cfpb/cfpb-buttons to link @cfpb/cfpb-buttons to cfgov-refresh.  gulp build in cfgov-refresh to compile your stylesheets.  Start cfgov-refresh and navigate to a page with buttons to view your @cfpb/cfpb-buttons changes.  When you’re pleased with your changes, cd back to your design-system repo and commit your changes: git commit -am \"Fix button border radius\"  git push origin button-fix to push your branch up to GitHub.  Go to https://github.com/cfpb/design-system and open a pull request to merge button-fix into master.First-time contributor?If you are not a current contributor to this repository, use forks by first clicking the fork button on top of the repository and cloning your fork in step 1. In the final step, go to https://github.com/cfpb/design-system and file a pull request by clicking the link to compare changes across forks.Updating DocumentationThe Design System’s website lives in this repository’s docs/ directory and is powered by Netlify CMS and Jekyll.

For example, we don’t deliver interactive scripting for Internet Explorer 8, but we do ensure that default browser features continue to work so users can access the site and its contents.              Edge  Opera  iOS Safari  Opera Mini  Android Browser  BlackBerry Browser  Opera Mobile  Chrome for Android  Firefox for Android  Samsung InternetBrowser TestingFor automated testing, we use a headless version of Chrome to ensure the majority of the site is working as expected.For manual testing, we test locally or in a virtual environment with the following browsers: Chrome; Firefox; Safari; Internet Explorer 8, 9, 10, and 11; Edge; iOS Safari; and Chrome for Android.AutoprefixerAutoprefixer parses our CSS and adds vendor prefixes to rules where necessary using reported feature support by Can I Use. For more information visit the Autoprefixer documentation site.  #### Babel  Babel compiles our ES6 JavaScript where necessary for the browsers that either don’t support or have limited support of ES6 features. For more information visit the Babel documentation site.  #### Known feature differences  JavaScript: We do not serve interactive scripting to IE 8 but we do deliveranalytics via JavaScript.  Icons: We currently use icon fonts to deliver scalable icons. Browsers thatdo not support icon fonts unfortunately do not receive backups but we try toalways pair icons with text.Resources  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/  https://saucelabs.com/beta/dashboard/tests  http://developer.samsung.com/remotetestlab/rtlDeviceList.action#Release managementReady to publish changes to npm?  Ensure you’re on master and git pull to confirm you’re up-to-date.  Export a personal access token calledGITHUB_AUTH.  Run yarn run changelog and open CHANGELOG.md to see a previewof new changelog entries.We use a tool that scans ourPull Requests for specific labels so if you see a PR missing from the changelog,ensure it has been labeled breaking, enhancement, bug,documentation or internal.  If you’re pleased with the changelog preview,git checkout CHANGELOG.md to reset it.  Run yarn run release to start the release.  If all packages are shown as having been published,run git push to push changes to the remote master branch.Lerna will update the changelog, ask for a new version number, create a git tag, push to GitHub and publish to npm.NotesThe CSS and JavaScript files that are generated during the build task are only used for testing. Because this project doesn’t necessarily produce a final product it is up to the projects that use it to generate and maintain their own browser support config. An example of this is consumerfinance.gov, which generates specific IE 8 and 9 stylesheets, whereas the Design System build task bundles those with the main stylesheet. Despite the differences in delivery, the output and support are the same.Adhere to any linting errors or warningsThe gulp lint linting tasks that are set up within the build processes are there to promote consistency. When contributing code please publicly track that there are no linting errors or warnings using the testing checklist in the pull request description.Follow our CSS naming conventionsWe are using a customized BEM format.block-name .block-name_element-name .block-name__block-modifier .block-name_element-name__element-modifierAvoid creating elements of modifiersAppending an element name to a modifier class can result in a confusing class name like .list__space_item. Avoid this in favor of using a descendant, like this: .list__spaced .list_item.Shoot for mobile first declarationsIn most cases styles should be declared mobile first, then enhanced with min-width media queries. By doing this we create a base experience that all devices can use and one that does not require media query support.",

            'description': "Whether you’re using Excel, Tableau, D3.js, or any other program, follow these guidelines to create effective and consistent data visualizations.Data visualization can be an excellent way to increase understanding and make comparisons of data. Each graph should have a point that you want the user to walk away knowing.Using visuals to convey meaning and to tell stories engages the user and creates a memorable experience. Part of this is choosing the correct visualization for the data. Make sure you understand the data and the relationship of your data before you choose visuals to help explain it to others.Occasionally, data visualization isn’t the best approach. A well crafted sentence or table may be a better solution to convey specific points or a precise numerical interpretation. Graphs are most useful when you want the user to walk away with a general sense of the data and to interpret patterns.KEY QUESTIONS  Is data visualization necessary to help achieve your objective?  Do you understand the data set?  What do you want people to walk away knowing?This page is under active development. Information is being moved into it from this page:  http://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/data-visualization/data-visualization.htmlUsageUse casesConsider your audience when you’re creating data visualization.KEY QUESTIONS  Who is your audience?  What is their familiarity with data visualization?  How much information do they need?If your user group is general (i.e. the American public)For the general public, stick with basic and most common chart types that people can easily understand. Adding emphasis and labels will help highlight the point of the visual and tell the story of the information. Consider using multiple simple charts to step the user through the data, rather than one big complex visualization.If your user is refined to a specific audienceWhen you’re creating visualizations for a specific target, take into consideration their familiarity with the data, visualization types, and the terminology used to label and describe data. More complex stories might necessitate more complex visuals, however, this does not mean it should lack emphasis.Content guidelinesChart componentsUsing the appropriate font not only increases consistency with the core brand, but assures legibility and good visual hierarchy. Proper labeling and titles help users quickly understand the chart and increases comprehension as well as helping with accessibility.KEY QUESTIONS  Does your chart have a descriptive title and subtitle so someone who cannot see the chart could understand the general trends?  Have you included notes and a data source?  Is it clear when the data is from?FontAll data, labels and titles for data visualizations should be in a sans-serif font. The preferred choices for fonts are: Avenir Next over Arial, and Arial over another sans serif font.While serif fonts are generally easier to read for long blocks of text, data visualizations rarely include long blocks. The lack of serifs, especially on numbers, helps cut down on the amount of lines and visual clutter. This lack also increases the legibility of small text by eliminating thin serifs.TitlesTitles should be as descriptive as possible to give users a sense of what the chart will be about. This not only provides users a framework of what they are looking at, but also helps with 508 accessibility and decreases the amount of text necessary in alt tags.Labels and keysWherever possible, charts should not include a key, and data should be directly labeled. This reduces the cognitive burden for the user so they are not hunting for labels and trying to connect colors to the data.ReportsFigure number  Uses the Figure number style (all caps)Title  Gives an overview of what the graph is about  Uses the h3 heading style  2 lines of text maximumSubtitle  Explains the general trends of the graph and what that means, including why it is important  Uses the h4 heading style  3 lines of text maximumNotes  Describes any caveats or inconsistencies with the data such as explaining why numbers do not add up to 100% or the specific dates that the data is pulled fromData source information  Provides a link to the URL of a spreadsheet or to the source of the data  Important to include for trustworthiness and validity  Allows people to dive deeper into the data and explore the nuances for themselves or to replicate the visualizationBlog postsTitle  Gives an overview of what the graph is about  Uses the h3 heading style  2 lines of text maximumSubtitle  Explains the general trends of the graph and what that means, including why it is important  Uses the h4 heading style  3 lines of text maximumNotes  Describes any caveats or inconsistencies with the data such as explaining why numbers do not add up to 100% or the specific dates that the data is pulled fromDate  Include a date to at least the month and year of when the data was collected to provide context and accuracy over time.Data source information  Provides a link to the URL of a spreadsheet or to the source of the data  Important to include for trustworthiness and validity  Allows people to dive deeper into the data and explore the nuances for themselves or to replicate the visualizationSocial mediaTitle  Gives an overview of what the graph is about  Uses the h3 heading style  2 lines of text maximumSubtitle  Explains the general trends of the graph and what that means, including why it is important  Uses the h4 heading style  3 lines of text maximumNotes  Describes any caveats or inconsistencies with the data such as explaining why numbers do not add up to 100% or the specific dates that the data is pulled fromDate  Include a date to at least the month and year of when the data was collected to provide context and accuracy over time.Data source information  Provides a link to the URL of a spreadsheet or to the source of the data  Important to include for trustworthiness and validity  Allows people to dive deeper into the data and explore the nuances for themselves or to replicate the visualizationCFPB logo  Include the CFPB logo; helps with identification and determining origin if the graphic gets re-usedAccuracyA chart is only as good as the validity of its data. It’s important to check both the data and chart several times with multiple people before publishing. One small error can invalidate the integrity of an entire visualization. Several errors in data accuracy can damage credibility.KEY QUESTIONS  Is this an accurate way to represent this data?  Did someone else look at the chart and data for feedback?  If there are percentages, do they add up to 100? Why not?  What is the source of the data?Notes sectionWhen using charts that show percentages, users expect things to add up to 100%. If they don’t it undermines the integrity of the visuals by leaving the user with missing pieces.To remedy this effect add a note at the bottom to explain the missing data.  Example: Percentages may not sum to 100% due to rounding.Use notes to add in other caveats around the data like if it was taken from a specific time period.Example: Percent change is based on a 3 month period (October-December) and compared to the previous year. &gt; &gt; Example: Company-level information should be considered in context of total complaints, company size and market share in a given geographic area.  Sources section  Including the source of the data in the visualization is a must. It adds credibility and transparency to the graph. The visualization could then be replicated using the mentioned sources which adds credibility.If you’re unable to link to the source, link to a spreadsheet of the data used to create the visualization.  Emphasis  Highlighting parts of your chart will help users quickly understand the point of the graphic and accurately comprehend the information.  KEY QUESTIONS      What is the point of the chart?    Can someone who hasn’t seen the chart before figure out the point from a quick look and the title?  Visual hierarchyGood visual hierarchy allows the user to focus on the most important piece of content first and work their way into the graphic. The title and subtitle should be the first thing that the user reads when viewing the chart to give them context of what the chart is about. Therefore, they should be the biggest thing on the chart.Use the squint test (take a step back from your graph, squint your eyes, and say what you see first, second, third…) to get a sense of what your users will automatically identify first.LabelsGoals, trends, and important outliers should be highlighted to help the user discern what is going on with the data. Labels will help the user understand the data and make sense of what it is showing.Projected valuesWhen dealing with projected or predicted data, the predicted data should be deemphasized. Use a color change to a lighter tint or dashed outline for bar charts, a dotted line for line charts, and a label explaining what part of the data is predicted or projected.AccessibilityAllowing all users to be able to comprehend charts and graphics is a key part of being a government agency that serves the entire American public. This is an interpretation of what it means for a chart to be 508 compliant and accessible, starting with descriptive titles and not only relying on color to connect data to its meaning.KEY QUESTIONS  How would someone using a screen reader interact with this visualization?  How would someone with low vision interact with this visualization?Alt tagsAlt tags are what a screen reader will say instead of the image. This is important for not only web materials, but charts that are in pdfs and charts that are placed as images into word documents.Screen readers read all of the text in an alt tag without allowing users to speed up, or skip. Make sure the information in the alt tag is descriptive but succinct.Alt tags should include:      One sentence of what the chart is, including the chart type for users with limited vision who can see part of it, but may not be able to have a full understanding of the graph.          Example: Bar chart showing complaints by type for New York metro area, New York state and the United States.            A link to a CSV or other machine-readable data format with the data so people with impaired vision can tab through the data with a screen reader. The data should have descriptive column labels and provide a link.  Color contrast and color blindnessSee the color section guidelines.",

            'title': 'Forms',
            'description': "Web forms provide an incredible advantage over paper forms in their potential for accessibility, usability, and operational efficiency, but when designed without users in mind, they can lose many of these benefits. In this guide, we’ve outlined several ways to ensure the best possible user experience.This page is under active development. Information is being moved into it from this page:  http://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/page-components/form-fields.htmlChoosing a form structureThe structure of your form should fit with the ways in which your users will want to use it.Ask yourself:  Will your users want to move through the form in a fixed order, or one of their choosing?  Will they be able to complete the form in a single go?  Will their answers affect other parts of the form?  Will they want to go back and review or change answers to previous questions?  Will they need to add or remove items from a list, or change the order of things?  How many parties are involved in the form?  Do any parts of the form take place offline?  At what point is the form regarded as complete?How you answer these questions will help you decide how to structure the form. It can help to think in terms of levels: sections, subsections, groups, etc. Try not to worry about how those levels should be represented in the interface until you have a broader understanding of the overall structure.For example, on a website, you might choose to have one section per page, or multiple sections per page. It depends on what’s going to work best for your users.Example structuresOption 1: Single pageAll sections are positioned on a single page.The good  There’s only one submit button to press  A single URL gives access to all form fields  It doesn’t force a fixed order of completion  You benefit from context of neighboring sections  Progress is self-evidentThe bad  Long forms can be overwhelming and off-putting  It’s less well suited to branching or non-linear flow  How do you save partial progress?  Can be harder to track analytics like drop-off ratesOption 2: WizardEach section goes on its own page.The good  It’s easier to handle branching and dependencies between sections  It’s easier to let the user save progress  A long form can feel more manageable  Easier to guide a user through an unfamiliar process  Easier to capture analytics like drop-off rates for each sectionThe bad  Can be harder for users to see where they are within the form  It can slow users down as they have to click and load each section  You lose the contextual information from neighboring sections  Harder for users to review and edit previous sections  There’s no single place for users to go back and edit their data  Not a natural fit for non-linear processes like looping, adding and removingOption 3: Accordion formAll sections on a single page, but each new section only appears once the previous section has been completed. Done well, option 3 is a hybrid of the other two that has benefits of both the other options.Within this hybrid option there are still some important design decisions to make, for example:  Will future questions be shown in any way or will you only see the questions you’ve answered?  What happens if you go back and edit a previous question?  Does the current question stay open or closed?  How do you get back to the current question once you’ve edited a previous one?  Do you lose all your answers to questions that follow the one you go back to edit?The good  Can handle branching and dependencies between sections  Can easily review and edit previous questions  Can help guide a user through an unfamiliar process  User still benefits from some surrounding context  Progress is clearThe bad  Implementation and interface is more complexOption 4: HybridFor more complicated forms, some combination of the other options might be your best bet. Done well, this can give you the benefits of both the single page and wizard approaches. It also allows you to create a sense of rhythm to the overall flow, which can help users understand when they have moved into a different part of the form, and break up the monotony of filling in forms.As always, these design decisions must have a strong, user-centred rationale behind them.Helping usersYou should be aiming for a service that’s so intuitive people don’t need any help in using it. If you find yourself explaining the interface within the interface it’s a sign that something has gone wrong.Sometimes though, people are going to need extra help. Many government forms involve concepts and terminology that people will be unfamiliar with. Some of this stuff takes a lot of explaining, so we need a way of providing contextual help of varying degrees of detail throughout a form.Methods for providing extra help:INLINE HELPShort, snappy text, positioned near the part of the interface it refers to. If it’s something that everyone needs to know, make it permanently visible.PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSUREA fancy phrase for hiding stuff until it’s clicked on. Used carefully this is a good way of keeping the interface free from potentially confusing clutter. Only use this for help that’s intended for a small subset of your audience (say, less than 10%).FIELD MASKINGWhen a specific data entry format is required, as for phone numbers, dates, and social security numbers, provide an example of the required format (e.g., XXX-XX-XXXX).RICH CONTEXTUAL HELPSometimes you need to give users access to supporting content, in case they’re unfamiliar with the terminology or concepts involved in the form. This kind of content should probably exist as a page outside of the form, and then be repurposed in some way within the form.Communicating errorsDespite providing the best possible helper text and contextual help, you should still plan for when users make errors when filling out your forms.Tips for communicating errors:INDICATE OPTIONAL AND/OR REQUIRED FIELDSIf most of the fields are required, leave them alone and just mark the optional fields as optional. If most of the fields are optional, leave them alone and just mark the required fields as required. If it’s close to a tie, go with whichever choice might be better for your users.COMBINE FIELD-LEVEL ERROR TEXT WITH A PAGE-LEVEL ERROR MESSAGEThis is particularly important for accessibility. If someone is using a screenreader to navigate the page, a digest of errors at the top of the page will help them understand which fields need fixing. Including anchor links to the invalid fields will allow them to find and fix the error without re-navigating the entire form.BE DESCRIPTIVE WITH ERROR TEXTTell the user what caused the error and how to correct it.VALIDATE FIELDS BEFORE THE USER SUBMITSCheck for errors as the user fills out the form (e.g., using javascript) and provide inline messaging with instructions for how to correct the error.Also consider including affirmative inline validation (such as green checkmarks) for required text fields, especially those that require specific formats or character counts, such as Zip Codes and passwords.Saving progressIf the average time to complete a form is more than you can reasonably expect your users to spend in a single session, then you need to provide a way for them to save their progress.The same goes if the session is likely to be interrupted for some reason. For example, if the user is suddenly asked for information which they might not have immediately on hand (a way to mitigate this is to warn users if they’re going to be asked for that kind of information). Another example is that the user might start a form on their mobile device and want to continue filling it out on their desktop computer.Setting expectationsThe further in to a form someone gets, the more time they have invested in it and the greater their annoyance if they have to abandon it for some reason.Be honest about what you’re offering users, and what you’re not offering them. In particular, people need to know up front about any:  Costs involved  Waiting periods or delays  Uncommon or hard-to-find infomation they’ll need to provide  Constraints on who can complete the form (age, nationality, etc)  Equipment that will be required (e.g., a printer)  Non-digital parts of the formUse common sense, though. Don’t try to make everyone read a page of terms and conditions before they start (they won’t).The best approach is to meet (or exceed) people’s expectations. For example, if your delivery times are typical and you accept all the usual payment methods then you won’t need to warn everyone about them up front.Keeping it simpleEvery request for information from the user:  Requires additional physical and cognitive effort  Creates another opportunity for them to get something ‘wrong’  Increases the time it takes to complete the form  Increases the perception that the service is invasive  Increases the risk that users will give up or fail to submit your formAsking for information because ‘it might be useful’ or ‘it helps with our record keeping’ should be considered against all of these factors.AttributionThis guide on effective forms has been adapted from the guide Designing transactions in the GOV.UK Government Service Design Manual, which is licensed under the Open Government License v2.0.",

This component can be used by itself, but is designed to work with Capital Framework.We subscribe to the guidance offered by Chris Coyier in his article, “A Pretty Good SVG Icon System”, in which he concludes, “Just include the icons inline.”Because including raw SVG code is not necessarily pretty or user-friendly, we encourage using your templating system to include them by reference.  Note: Jinja2, the templating language that cfgov-refresh uses, has a near-identical syntax for includes, but it requires that the path be enclosed in quotation marks, like so: {% include 'icons/download.svg' %}.The filenames of the SVGs included with cf-icons match the names in the Icon library section. There are duplicate SVG files for each alias, as well.  Note to contributors: If any icon is ever updated, you must be sure to also update each of the alias SVGs.What the Less is doingIf you look in cf-icons.less, below the aforementioned sizing variable, you’ll see this simple rule:.cf-icon-svg {    height: @cf-icon-height;    vertical-align: text-top;    fill: currentColor;    …}Referring back to the example above, you can see that we have encoded class=\"cf-icon-svg\" in the root element of each of our SVG icons. As a result, the Less rule gets applied to all of the SVGs on the page, just like any other HTML element.We start by limiting the size of the SVG to a proportion of the text height, using the @cf-icon-height variable’s em value. To align the canvas of the icon with the canvas of neighboring text, we set vertical-align: text-top;. Finally, setting fill: currentColor; tells the SVG to set its path’s fill color to match the color value of its parent element.CaveatsThere are two modifications based on restrictions in Internet Explorer 8 and 9 (IE8/IE9).First, IE8 does not support fill: currentColor. Typically the fallback would be to use a PNG image, but due to the inability to know what the background or text color of its surroundings are, we found it better to fall back to the paired text with no icon.Second, IE9 displays SVGs as full width by default (not the paths, just the SVG container). To eliminate this issue we’ve set the width of the SVGs to match the height. The whitespace to the left or right may not be quite accurate, but we determined this is an acceptable difference for a legacy browser like IE9.Inline SVG backgroundIn some cases we embed an SVG as a background image. To accomplish this, a custom less plugin is used to inject the SVG icon source file inline into the CSS background-image property. This is exposed via a mixin, .u-svg-inline-bg( @name ), where @name is the SVG icon canonical name.",

            'description': "The Design System provides a set of modular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript patterns that can be used both collectively and individually. There are several ways to integrate it into your project:  Installing a single component with npm or yarn  Using the generator  Using Less  Downloading the compiled CSSOur recommended workflow if you are starting a new codebase is to use the generator to scaffold out a new Design System project. This allows you to pick and choose your modules as well as providing a solid front end build process.Installing a single component with npm or yarnJust want one or two CF components and not the entire framework?Simply install and @import only the components you need.Install with yarn or npmPick one:yarn add cf-buttons cf-iconsornpm install cf-buttons cf-iconsImport CSS@import (less) \"node_modules/@cfpb/cfpb-buttons/src/cfpb-buttons.less\";@import (less) \"node_modules/@cfpb/cfpb-icons/src/cfpb-icons.less\";/* the rest of your stylesheet… */  NOTE: Be sure to run the Less files through  Autoprefixer,  or your compiled CSS might not work perfectly in older browsers.Import JavaScriptimport Expandable from '@cfpb/cfpb-expandables/src/Expandable'';Expandable.init( document.querySelector( '#container' ) );Using the generatorTo use the generator, you will need Node.js,Yeoman, and Gulp.Installing dependenciesNode.js can be downloaded and installed directly from the Node website, or by using a package manager for your system. At the CFPB we use Homebrew. To install the dependencies:brew install node  # if installing node with Homebrewnpm install --global gulp yo generator-cfScaffolding out a projectTo create a new project, create a directory, cd into that directory, and run the yo cf command:mkdir my-awesome-projectcd my-awesome-projectyo cfThe generator will prompt you to complete information about the project and choose the Design System modules you would like to use.Navigating the project folderOnce the generator has finished you’ll have a folder full of files and folders.Here’s a quick guide on working with these files:  Run npm run build to process the files in src and output them to dist.  To view your site, go to the dist directory and start a local server: cd dist &amp;&amp; python -m SimpleHTTPServer. You can now navigate to localhost:8000 in your web browser.  Edit files within the src directory and re-run npm run build to view changes.Editing the Less and JSThe generator has created a starter Less file at src/static/css/main.less.This file includes all of the necessary imports needed for Capital Framework.There is also a starter JavaScript file at src/static/js/main.js.Both main.less and main.js are already wired into Gruntfile.js (or gulp/tasks/if you selected gulp) so compiling is as easy as running npm run build. It alsocopies files from src into dist, which will update what you see at localhost:8000/.Theming / CustomizingYou can override component UI colors within src/static/css/cf-theme-overrides.less.This is already set up for you and gets imported by main.less.If you would like to use your own color palette simply replace the contents ofbrand-palette.less with your own color variables,then update cf-theme-overrides.less by overriding each UI color variablewith a color from brand-palette.less or any color of your choosing.The same applies when you need to add custom styles to your project.You can add any custom .less files to your project that you may need,just remember to import them in main.less using the correct path.Using LessIf you don’t want to use the generator,you can just download the source files and import them into your project.  NOTE: Be sure to run the Less files through  Autoprefixer,  or your compiled CSS will  not work perfectly in older browsers.Run npm install capital-framework. This will download Capital Framework to yourproject’s node_modules directory. You can then import the framework intoyour application’s primary Less file:@import (less) \"node_modules/capital-framework/src/capital-framework.less\";/* the rest of your stylesheet… */Just want one or two CF components and not the entire framework?Simply install and @import only the components you need.npm install cf-buttons cf-icons@import (less) \"node_modules/cf-buttons/src/cfpb-buttons.less\";@import (less) \"node_modules/cf-icons/src/cfpb-icons.less\";/* the rest of your stylesheet… */Downloading the compiled CSSCapital Framework’s compiled CSS can be downloaded here.Download it and copy the files found in the dist/ directory to your project.Use standard &lt;link&gt; and &lt;script&gt; tags.&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;    &lt;title&gt;My Awesome Project&lt;/title&gt;    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"capital-framework.min.css\"&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;    &lt;!-- Your project's HTML goes here. --&gt;    &lt;script src=\"capital-framework.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;",

A soft beam of light symbolizes our efforts to illuminate the financial landscape and foster transparency in the marketplace.  Lockups  Horizontal  The horizontal lockup is the primary option and appears on our stationery and website.    Vertical  The vertical lockup is useful for square frames or narrow columns.    Isolated  The isolated logo is primarily used for internal-facing communications. For all external communications, the logo needs to be in a lockup with “Consumer Financial Protection Bureau” to ensure clear communication.    Small execution  The small execution lockup is used when the logo needs to scale down to less than 0.75” or 54 pixels at 72 dpi. The small execution logo allows “Consumer Financial Protection Bureau” to remain legible.  Variations  Spanish logo  The Spanish logo should be used for Spanish language materials, such as websites and microsites, publications, and signage.  This is applicable for the horizontal, vertical, and small execution lockups.    One color logo  When the logo is being produced for print formats conditions may not allow for full color. For these rare cases, the one-color logo may be used only in black on a white background.This is applicable for the horizontal, vertical, isolated, and small execution lockups.

For large-format print pieces, such as posters and banners, where the logo is used with a height greater than 1”, it should be used in increments of 1/2”.      8.5 x 11” documents              Lockup: horizontal      Height: 0.5”      Clear space: 0.25”            8.5 x 11” documents              Lockup: vertical      Height: 0.77”      Clear space: 0.25”        Complex backgrounds  The logo should be shown on a white background for optimal appearance.

It’s focused on navigation and content.  It’s a good and ever-improving experience.More detailed version of design principles  Our mega menu is based on industry standards around web development and user expectations around interactions. The mega menu works:  across our supported browsers,  across different browser sizes (and not just device form factors),  across the spectrum of user ability levels or technology familiarity, and  in line with the standard interactions for different assistive techniques.      Our mega menu is designed to be equitable and provides full navigational support to all users. This includes users with physical disabilities, hearing and visual impairments, mental disorders, cognitive disabilities, or seizure disorders. Our mega menu is accessible and usable by all who use assistive technologies regardless of what type of disability they might have or their percentage within our larger user base. We do not ignore the needs of the few to only focus on the many.        Our mega menu fully aligns with the WCAG core accessibility principles known as POUR: every part of it is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for all users.        Our mega menu is built mobile-first with semantic code to focus on the content and navigation elements within it. It’s designed to work with the interaction defaults of both JAWS and Apple VoiceOver. The visual design supports all of these factors and doesn’t supersede them.        We maintain a good mega menu experience for our users and actively work to improve it. All the designers and developers in the department read, share, and know where to find basic information about the mega menu. We are aware of its guidelines, its complexities, and what traps to avoid falling into when modifying it. We monitor and publish our site analytics for the mega menu on a regular basis to make sure that we’re continually aware of how users are using it and able to make necessary adjustments over time as needed. We also usability test the mega menu with external users as a part of the monitoring process.  The consumerfinance.gov website mega menu is composed of five verticals: Consumer Tools, Practitioner Resources, Data &amp; Research, Policy &amp; Compliance, and About Us. The visual layout, spacing, and some portion of the content guidelines will change in the near future, as we monitor analytics information.",

Research also shows 7 is around the maximum number of items that one can scan and comfortably hold in short-term memory. The idea is to minimize cognitive load by grouping like items into categories that can be easily scanned and that line up with the user’s mental models.  For a vertical with two sections, one section can have 14 links maximum, the other section up to 7 links maximum, given space for a featured item, which occupies the fourth column.

Label columns precisely and include units of measurement where necessary. Organize the data so that the underlying meaning is quickly apparent.Labels and TitlesGive tables a meaningful title that succinctly describes the content presented so that users can understand their purpose at a glance. If presenting more than one table within a page, consider adding labels (e.g. “Table 1,” “Table 2,” etc.) in addition to titles. Labels should precede titles (e.g. “Table 1: The title given to this table”).Long column labelsConsider using fixed columns or truncation for column labels that are significantly longer than the expected width of the data.Unit of measurementMake sure to indicate the unit of measurement. In terms of placement, if the units are the same across columns, indicate the unit of measurement in the title or someplace noticeable above the table.Alternatively, if the table uses at most two units of measurement, consider using asterisks following the column label, and define the unit of measurement below the table, as shown in the example here.If units differ from column to column, the standard is to list the unit of measure in parentheses following the column label. Make sure to use common abbreviations when indicating units of measure. Spell out any ambiguous or obscure abbreviations.BehaviorSince the nature of tables relies so much on visual space, there are several common variations that can be used to accommodate different types of data in a table.Stacking tablesA default table would “stack” the information on a smaller screen, since shrinking a table that maintained its columns/row structure would make it illegible.Directory tablesWhen the data you’re presenting should only be read across the rows (instead of down columns), you can use a directory table. The first column in these tables is what organizes or labels the other data points in the row.For instance, contact information is comprised of a name, phone number, and email address. An event is made up of the name of the event, time, and location. You need all three pieces of data to create an understanding of the thing being shown, and the first column of data is the key to that understanding.The default stacking behavior on smaller breakpoints doesn’t maintain that “first column” importance since it stacks based on column headers.As such, at the small screen breakpoint, the directory table pattern uses that first column data (employee name, for instance) as a way to group and label stacks of rows.See guidance on styles for a a directory table and how it should look on smaller breakpoints.Scrolling tablesWhen the data you’re presenting has more columns than what will comfortably fit on the screen, you can use a table that scrolls horizontally. This becomes especially important when thinking about tables on smaller screens, instead of allowing the data to stack at smaller breakpoints.Using a table that scrolls ensures that all the information can be accessed in its original tabular structure, even on a smaller screen.See guidance on styles for a table that scrolls horizontally at all screen sizes.Sorting tablesAt large screen sizes, tables can be sorted using the header of any sortable column.

This provides the eye a constant starting point for each line, making text easier to read.Line heightAmple space between lines of type promotes an open feeling and lends flow to body copy.When setting body copy, the leading should be 1.375 times the type size, or 37.5% larger.Line lengthComfortable line length allows the user’s eyes to flow easily from the end of one line to the beginning of the next.For a single column of text, line length should be an average of 66 characters per line, including spaces, but may range from 50 to 75 characters.SpacingWhite space affects how the user focuses their attention on the content. It makes it easier to know what to read and where to begin. Spacing between typographic elements should be open enough to feel light, but close enough to establish a proper relationship between elements.Heading followed by body copyWhen a heading is followed by paragraph text, include 30px of space below Display and 15px below Headings 1–6.Body copy followed by a headingWhen body copy is followed by a heading, include 45px of space above Heading 2 and 30px above Headings 3–6.Heading followed by a headingFor stacked headings, include 30 px of space after the primary heading.Body copy spacingFor multiple paragraphs within the same section set the space between paragraphs to 15px.",
