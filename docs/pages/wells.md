guidelines: >-
  Wells should generally be text-based. If content must include imagery or
  videos, use the [featured content
  module](/design-system/patterns/featured-content-module) instead. 


  Examples of types of content to include:


  * Headings (H2 - H5). Headings should be as succinct as possible and 35 characters or less (including spaces)

  * Text (including bullets and numbered lists). Text should be succinct.

  * Links
eyebrow: Featured content
title: Wells
description: Wells are used to highlight specific information within a
  designated section of a page. This breaks up the flow of content on the page
  and helps to emphasize and set apart the content that is included. They are
  generally used on
  [browse](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/pages/browse-pages),
  [learn](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/pages/learn-pages), and [document
  detail
  pages](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/pages/document-detail-pages).
use_cases: >-
  Grey wells should be used to feature content or specific calls to action.
  They  will help visually set apart the content within it, so use sparingly to
  draw attention to that content.


  Ideally, content within a well should not take up more than a third of page content.
behavior: Wells are full width. At breakpoints 600px and under there are slight
  padding adjustments to maximize real estate on smaller displays.
