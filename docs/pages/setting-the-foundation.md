  ## Working together


  [Identify lived experiences and biases](#identify-lived-experiences-and-biases)


  [Investigate internalized oppression](#investigate-internalized-oppression)


  [Use bias-free, person-centered language](#use-bias-free-person-centered-language)


  [Establish team values](#establish-team-values)


  [Assemble diverse teams](#assemble-diverse-teams)


  ### Identify lived experiences and biases


  Bias is the tendency to allow personal opinions and past experiences to influence one’s judgment. Many of these biases may be unconscious, but they are nonetheless damaging to others. They are often based on false stereotypes about a particular group. It’s part of the human condition to rely on these cognitive shortcuts and to assume others think like us or have similar values, opinions, and beliefs.


  Bias can skew our research and design activities, whether in our choice of who participates, what information is collected, or how information is interpreted. Awareness of our biases is key to mitigating against them, and that’s where the frames of reference exercise can be particularly valuable.

  <p class="h5">{% include icons/edit.svg %} ACTIVITY</p>

  <h4 class="h3" id="frames-of-reference">Frames of reference</h4>

  *Adapted from 18F’s [presentation on equity-centered design and research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ZJO8maV7s)*


  As a team, run through this activity to identify your individual and collective biases before beginning research or design activities. If possible, couple the exercise with a review of what you have learned about the audience.


  Everyone should choose how they want to participate, but ideally this can be a group activity.

  <h5 class="h4">Template</h5>

  We've created a template that teams can use to run the activity, available in several formats, including as a template for teams that use Mural as a digital collaboration tool:

  <ul class="m-list">
    <li class="m-list__item">
        <a href="/design-system/images/uploads/frames-of-reference-template.pdf" aria-label="Download the frames of reference template as a PDF">PDF</a>
    </li>
    <li class="m-list__item">
        <a href="/design-system/images/uploads/frames-of-reference-template.png" aria-label="Download the frames of reference template as a PNG">PNG</a>
    </li>
    <li class="m-list__item">
        <a href="/design-system//guidelines/frames-of-reference-mural-template" aria-label="Use the frames of reference template in Mural">Mural</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="h4">Instructions</h5>

  The template guides teams through the three main phases of the activity.

  <ol>
    <li>
      To begin, brainstorm as a team what frames of reference are most important for your team to reflect on. The template contains a number of common frames of reference. More examples can be found in 18F’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScI0iTQEstjECMzFVuyMt0Giku69YggEkAlybQPlH4y7Ik9Vg/viewform">frames of reference form</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Next, add your experiences with each frame of reference. The template gives a number of options for doing that in a way that's safe and comfortable for everyone, including:
        <ul class="m-list">
          <li class="m-list__item">
            Asking participants to add their findings anonymously to the team's collaboration tool, emphasizing that everyone should choose how they wish to participate in this activity
          </li>
          <li class="m-list__item">
            Gathering and organizing anonymized responses as a team
          </li>
          <li class="m-list__item">
            Reflecting on your own lived experiences individually
          </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Finally, brainstorm biases that might arise and make a plan to mitigate them.
    </li>
  </ol>

  * The [positionality wheel](https://design.ncsu.edu/blog/2022/01/07/from-a-to-z-lesley-ann-noel-and-decolonizing-design/) is another form of the Frames of Reference exercise.

  * The Decision Lab has a [list of the most relevant cognitive biases in behavioral economics](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases), which can be applied to our own biases as designers and researchers, but also participants.

  * Nielsen Norman Group has several resources pertaining to bias in UX. Watch their video, [Decision Biases Affecting UX Practitioners](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/decision-biases-ux-practitioners/), to learn how to mitigate your own biases.


  ### Investigate internalized oppression


  We encourage everyone to read widely to examine their own identity and internalized oppression—the false narratives or stereotypes that they may have internalized about themselves, and how they might perpetuate systemic oppression.


  <p class="h5">{% include icons/book.svg %} FURTHER READING</p>


  For more information, Intentional Futures has a useful explanation of systemic oppression and how it manifests in their [Introduction to Equity-Centered Design](https://www.intentionalfutures.com/public/ecd-booklet.pdf). Additionally, consider using the [implicit bias test put together by Harvard](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/user/agg/blindspot/indexrk.htm), which is designed to identify unconscious positive and negative associations based on race.


  ### Use bias-free, person-centered language


  It’s important to use clear, respectful, inclusive language that’s free of stereotypes and generalizations. Our words matter, whether we’re addressing the general public or a fellow team member. Follow the guidelines below:


  <b>Ensure the terms and references you use to refer to a group are both respectful and accurate.</b><br>

  Some terms may not be accurate to describe a group, while other terms can have negative connotations. For example, as [18F points out, the term “American Indians and Alaskan Natives” is not an all-encompassing term for Indigenous Americans](https://github.com/18F/Equity-centered-design-with-American-Indians-and-Alaska-Natives-10x/wiki/Intro-Why-Equity-Centered-Design#words-that-carry-weight), as it does not include members of non-federally-recognized tribes, or Indigenous Americans who are not members of a tribe.


  Use the terminology that groups and individuals use for themselves. This includes the gender pronouns of any individuals you work with directly. Do your research, read the resources listed in the “Further Reading” section below, and ask members of the group in question directly if you’re in doubt.


  <b>Use people-first language.</b><br>

  [People-first language](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language/disability) is a way to respectfully acknowledge the humanity of an individual or group first, rather than the identity or condition they may experience. Examples of people-first language include “people with a mental disorder”, rather than calling someone “mentally ill”, or referring to someone as a “person without housing”, rather than as a “homeless person”. The specific terms preferred by an individual or group can vary, and do not always include people-first syntax; additionally, language is always changing. Refer to the resources in the “Further Reading” section below to better understand how to use people-first language, and always ask people directly how they wish to define themselves.


  <b>Consider avoiding the word “user” when referring to the people we serve.</b><br>

  In line with using people-first language, consider using the word “people” instead of “user” when referring to those we’re trying to help. “User” can depersonalize our intended audience, potentially reducing them to a one-dimensional data point. “People”, in contrast, acknowledges the many distinct individuals who are interacting with the services we create for them, and helps us think collectively about the multiplicity of their viewpoints and lived experiences.


  <p class="h5">{% include icons/book.svg %} FURTHER READING</p>


  * [APA’s Bias Free Language Guide](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language), in particular their [Inclusive Language Guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language/disability)

  <br>


  <div class="o-well" markdown="1">


  <p class="h5">{% include icons/edit.svg %} ACTIVITY</p>

  <h4 class="h3">﻿Set intentional language</h4>


  Take time during your team formation and when beginning a new project to review the guidelines and references above. [APA’s Bias Free Language Guide](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language) and [Language, Please](https://languageplease.org/) are both excellent guides to inclusive language, and contain robust lists of appropriate person- and identity- first terms. Discuss this guidance as a team and come to a shared understanding of language to use.

  <br>


  ### Establish team values


  Discussing and documenting your team values will enable your group to create a shared understanding of how you want to work together and why you’re making those choices. Revisit your team values throughout your work to stay grounded in your intentions.


  <div class="o-well" markdown="1">


  <p class="h5">{% include icons/edit.svg %} ACTIVITY</p>

  <h4 class="h3">Create a set of equity-centered team values</h4>


  For newly established teams, create team values that incorporate the results of both the frames of reference and intentional language exercises above. An example of team values could include, embracing discomfort, vulnerability, the awareness that we do not know everything, and understanding that just because we have not experienced something does not make it untrue.


  Once you’ve created your team values, find opportunities to regularly review your values as a team. For example, read these values during your sprint planning ceremonies.


  </div>

  <br>


  ### Assemble diverse teams


  Organizational leaders and managers should prioritize assembling teams with a diversity of lived experiences. Diversity is broad; it is the practice or quality of including or involving people from a range of different social and ethnic backgrounds.


  While this includes individuals of different races, genders, religions, sexual orientations, etc., it also includes individuals of different economic, geographic, or other backgrounds. In a diverse environment, every person has different knowledge, perspectives, and points of view that help us make better informed decisions. Assembling a diverse team can be informed by individual teams running the [frames of reference](#frames-of-reference) activity and giving input to their leaders.


  ## Beginning a project


  [Understand the project’s value](#understand-the-projects-value)


  [Learn how power structures can affect the people you serve](#learn-how-power-structures-can-affect-the-people-you-serve)


  [Examine your biases in the context of the project](#examine-your-biases-in-the-context-of-the-project)


  [Apply trauma-informed principles](#apply-trauma-informed-principles)


  ### Understand the project’s value


  Before a project begins, come to a shared understanding of its value—that is, a clear sense of the intended outcomes and value that key decision-makers envision creating. This is necessary to truly understand how the project might impact the audience.


  <br>


  <div class="o-well" markdown="1">


  <p class="h5">{% include icons/edit.svg %} ACTIVITY</p>

  <h4 class="h3">Write a problem statement</h4>


  Before engaging in any work, stakeholders and the project team should work together to create a problem statement identifying and framing the problem to explore through research or solve through design. Nielsen Norman has more about [how to form a problem statement](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/problem-statements/). 18F also has a [design hypothesis exercise](https://methods.18f.gov/decide/design-hypothesis/) that considers the value and impact of work on the intended audience.


  The team should also engage in [activities to validate the problem statement](https://methods.18f.gov/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/) once it’s been formed.


  </div>


  <br>


  ### Learn how power structures can affect the people you serve


  <b>If your product is for an underserved or underrepresented community, do some research.</b>


  * Research from a reliable source the community’s current and historical relationship with the government, along with an awareness of their history.

  * Investigate any injustices the community has faced at the hands of the government and any historic mistrust that has resulted.

  * Take time to learn about the regulations and/or policies currently in place which might affect the people and communities for who you are designing. Dig in to learn about how those policies evolved to be what they are today.

  * Explore any tension that might impact how you are perceived as a representative of the Federal government when engaging with these communities.


  As 18F points out in their [presentation on equity-centered design and research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ZJO8maV7s), people often access government services in their most vulnerable moments. Recognize the power imbalance between being a representative of the Federal government and the people we serve.


  Engage with the broader community (other government agencies, nonprofits, grassroots organizations, or other groups working on a community level) to seek out knowledge and additional perspectives.


  {% include icons/favorite.svg %} <b>Outside of your project work,</b> make efforts to educate yourself, your team, and your leadership. Start up a book club and develop a reading list for people to read at their own pace.


  <br>


  <div class="o-well" markdown="1">


  <p class="h5">{% include icons/edit.svg %} ACTIVITY</p>

  <h4 class="h3">Conduct research as a team</h4>


  As a team, divide up avenues to learn about the power structures, systems, and policymaking impacting the community for whom you’re designing.


  Plan a time to discuss what you learned and which sources you found valuable.


  </div>


  <br>


  ### Examine your biases in the context of the project


  During team formation, you should have spent time uncovering your biases and lived experiences. Take time to do the [frames of reference activity](#frames-of-reference) again as a team, taking into consideration the context of the project you’re beginning. Couple the activity with a review of [what you’ve learned about the audience](#learn-how-power-structures-can-affect-the-people-you-serve) for whom you’ll be designing.


  ### Apply trauma-informed principles


  Trauma is an event, a series of events, or a set of circumstances experienced by an individual or group as emotionally or physically harmful, and that has lasting effects on their sense of well-being. The trauma-informed approach aims to avoid re-traumatization of a person during the course of your work.


  People are not defined by their demographics or behaviors alone. Consider what events and circumstances may be impacting someone, especially when you know you need to work with vulnerable individuals or communities.


  {% include icons/favorite.svg %} <b>Ready to conduct research for your project?</b> Learn how to recognize and respond to trauma during a research session.


  #### Create a safe space for your team.


  It is possible that you and your team may experience second-hand trauma during a project. Sometimes called vicarious trauma, it’s when people have prolonged exposure to victims of trauma or sensitive topics related to traumatic experiences. [Learn about the signs for vicarious trauma](https://ovc.ojp.gov/program/vtt/what-is-vicarious-trauma#what-are-some-common-negative-reactions-to-vicarious-trauma) and make space to talk about how the work may be affecting the team. If you see someone on your team exhibiting signs of vicarious trauma, [there are several steps you can take](https://ovc.ojp.gov/program/vtt/what-is-vicarious-trauma#suggestions-for-coworkers).


  <p class="h5">{% include icons/book.svg %} FURTHER READING</p>


  Much of this guidance regarding trauma is based off well-established research and resources from experts. If you are interested in learning more about trauma and trauma-informed/responsive practices, [read this comprehensive report on trauma-informed approaches created by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA)](https://ncsacw.acf.hhs.gov/userfiles/files/SAMHSA_Trauma.pdf)
