***For documentation requests, use the documentation request issue template instead.***
 

**Before filling out the information below, be sure you can answer "yes" to one of the following questions and be sure to include that detail in the issue:**

***Change to existing component:***
- Is the proposed change due to an accessbility or usability issue with the existing component?
- Does the change alter the existing component in only one major way (e.g. color change)? If so, consider if it should a variation of the existing component rather than a replacement.

***Adding a new component***
- Is the proposed component currently being used on more than one page type on [www.consumberfinance.gov](www.consumerfinance.gov)? Alternatively, can you provide examples of multiple places where the proposed component could be used?
- Are existing Design System components not sufficiently able to server your product or users' needs, thus requiring the need to create a new component?
- Is the proposed component different in more than one major way from existing components in the Design System? If the proposed component is different from an existing component in only one way (e.g. color), it would likely be better to add it as a variant of the existing component.

If you were able to answer "yes" to any of the above questions the next steps are to prepare your change request for review by adding the following information to the GitHub issue. 

***For component update or new addtions, please be sure to include the following***

- Indiccate if your change request is for making a change to an existing component of for adding a new one to the Design System
- Add any data or research you have to show that the proposed change is accessbile and usable
- Supply any design and development context for your request you may have (e.g. Figma concepts, code samples, etc)
- Include if you can design and build the proposed change or if you will need to request that someone makes the changes for you
- Draft documentation for the proposed change to be included in the Design System website (can be included in this issue or in the comments)
