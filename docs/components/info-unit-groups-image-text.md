  to call attention to specific linked content.

      ![25/75 Image and text component
      example](/design-system/images/uploads/2575example_desktop.jpg "25/75
      Image and text component example")


      The 25/75 image and text component is used to draw the user’s eye to key
      information and navigation links, and aid comprehension by pairing content
      with illustration/imagery.


      When used in conjunction with half width link blob, it can help create a
      hierarchy of child pages or other content on the page, or can help feature
      a particular link over others.


      **When to use**


      * When a call-to-action, leading users to a deeper page in the section,
      needs a visual highlight on the page.

      * When an image or illustration helps users better understand the purpose
      of content.

      * Can be used for an even or odd number of items and may imply a hierarchy
      of information given the list style format.


      **When other options are better**


      * When content doesn’t require imagery. Suggest using the half width link
      blob pattern instead.

      * When there are multiple paragraphs of copy.


      **Behavior**


      At breakpoints below 601, the two-column pattern transitions into a single
      column and stacks each instance in Z-order.

      screenshot](/design-system/images/uploads/25-75-behavior.png "25-75
      component behavior screenshot")


      **Content guidelines**


      * Headings should be as succinct as possible, ideally staying on a single
      line at max column width; 60 characters or less.

      * Description beneath heading should also be succinct, ideally no more
      than 4 lines at max column width; 1-2 sentences, no more than 275
      characters.

      * Call to action link should be a single concise phrase starting with an
      action verb. Should stay on a single line at max column width; 65
      characters or less.


      **Style**

      component style screenshot")


      * Imagery: 1:1 ratio, may be illustration, isocon, or photography. 150px
      wide for 901+ px breakpoint and 130 px wide for 900 px breakpoint and
      below

      * Padding: 30px padding for imagery across responsive sizes

      * Headings: Any heading size may be used, recommend H2-6

      ![50/50 image and text
      component](/design-system/images/uploads/50_50_intro_mockup.png "50/50
      image and text component")


      The 50/50 image and text component is used to call attention to specific
      linked content on a page and feature it prodominantly. At larger
      breakpoints, this component has a two column layout to utilize extra
      screen real estate.


      The half-width link blob component is a variation of the 50/50 image and
      text that does not use imagery.


      **When to use**


      * When a call-to-action, leading users to a deeper page in the section,
      needs a visual highlight on the page.

      * When an image or illustration helps users better understand the purpose
      of content.

      * Ideally, when an even number of these components can be featured
      together.

      * To help establish a hierarchy of linked content on this page.


      **When other options are better**


      * When content doesn’t require imagery. Suggest using the half-width link
      blob component instead.

      * When there are multiple paragraphs of copy.


      **Behavior**


      At breakpoints below 601, the two-column pattern transitions into a single
      column and stacks each instance in Z-order.

      **Content guidelines**


      * Headings should be as succinct as possible, ideally staying on a single
      line at max column width (30 characters or less).

      * Description beneath heading should also be succinct, 2-3 lines at max
      column width of text; roughly 50-130 characters.

      * Call to action link should be one line; about 40 characters or less.
      Link content should follow link guidelines.


      **Style**

      screenshot](/design-system/images/uploads/50_50_style_mockup.png "50-50
      component style screenshot")


      * Imagery: 16:9 ratio, recommend 1600 x 900 pixels to account for retina
      displays.

      * Headings: Any heading size may be used, recommend H2-4.

      * Body copy: Avenir paragraph.

      * At breakpoints below 601: Heading sizes H3 and above automatically drop
      down one level and the mobile link style is used for the call to action
      link(s).
