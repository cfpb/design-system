guidelines: >-
  * Label your lines directly or use different patterns for each line.

  * Generally show five or fewer lines to avoid confusion.

  * Consider using many small line charts if you need to show more factors. (These are called small multiples charts.)

  * For color guidance, view [Data visualization palettes](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/foundation/color#data-visualization-palettes) on the Color page.
