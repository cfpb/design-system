  ## Welcome to the CFPB Design System 


  The Design System is an open-source resource for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) teams to produce effective, accessible, and consistent products that are easy for the American public to access, use, and understand. 


  ### Where to go first

  Start by reading our [general principles](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/foundation/general-principles), which form the strategic underpinnings for the CFPB’s design and development standards, and [accessibility principles](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/foundation/accessibility), which lay the foundation for ensuring that our web content is available for all users. Then go to one of the sections below to find information.


  * **Foundation**: This section includes our visual identity standards, such as color, grid, and typography. It forms the foundation for the CFPB’s website and external-facing materials. [Browse foundation](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/foundation/)


  * **Components**: Components contain the key building blocks of the design system that, when combined, can be used to create a website. Examples of components include buttons, text inputs, tables, and alerts. [Browse components](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/components/)


  * **Patterns**:  Patterns include interaction patterns, which combine components into best practice design solutions in order to allow users to achieve a goal; and layout patterns, for designers to use to organize content into clear, accessible web pages. [Browse patterns](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/patterns/)


  * **Pages**: Find out more about the common page types that we use within our content management system, which are documented for easy reference. [Browse pages](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/pages/)


  * **Development**: The development section includes utilities, such as variables, helper classes, and mixins, and layout options, such as blocks. [Browse development](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/development/) 


  * **Guidelines**: This section includes guidelines for creating specific product experiences not covered in other sections. [Browse guidelines](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/guidelines/) 


  ### Getting started for developers 

  Learn how to integrate our design system into your project, contribute to the code base, and update the documentation. [Get started](https://github.com/cfpb/design-system/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).


  The Design System also includes the source code for the common components that power the design of [consumerfinance.gov](https://www.consumerfinance.gov). [View source code on github]((https://github.com/cfpb/design-system) ).


  ### Contributing to the Design System

  We strongly encourage you to participate in the growth and maintenance of the Design System. To make contribution easier, the Design System is built on a tool called Netlify CMS, which allows for editing of pages in a web browser, without needing to use git or other command-line tools. [View instructions for contributing to the Design System](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/updating-this-website/).

  ##### About the CFPB Design System


  Our design system has been created to work with a wide range of devices and browsers. Following a modern, mobile first responsive approach, sites built with our Design System easily adapt to a wide range of screen sizes, all while carefully following accessibility best practices.

  As a work of the United States government, all code is open source and in the public domain. We encourage you to use this framework in your own projects and to contribute back.
