  Use bar or column charts to show comparisons of different discrete items,
  factors or categories. Comparisons could include items that can be counted and
  categorized. These are some of the easiest charts to interpret because the
  data is shown by length of bar.

  <h3>Content guidelines</h3>


  * If exact numbers are important, the bars should be labeled with the value.

  * When possible label directly rather than relying on color.

  * For stacked charts, use a white line or stroke to create contrast between
  bar chunks.
