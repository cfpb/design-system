  A carousel, otherwise known as a slideshow or image slider, allows multiple
  pieces of content to occupy high value real estate at the top of a landing
  page. From, [December
  2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191210233347/https://www.consumerfinance.gov/)
  to [February
  2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210201004337/https://www.consumerfinance.gov/),
  CFPB's homepage featured a carousel.


  Carousels offer poor usability and are considered an [anti-pattern](https://thegood.com/insights/ecommerce-image-carousels/). Their use is discouraged.

          The standard carousel organism is comprised of a set of blocks of
          content that can be navigated through sequentially. Each content item
          includes a title, description, link and image.

          Unlike other carousel patterns, CFPB's carousel does not automatically progress through its items. A user must either click the previous/next arrow or select one of the thumbnail previews at the bottom of the component.
