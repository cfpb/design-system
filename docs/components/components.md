  <p class="lead-paragraph">Components are individual elements that can be used
  to create a webpage. A few examples include buttons, text inputs, tables, and
  alerts. These elements have been built by our in-house designers and
  developers to help us create visually consistent web products as easily as
  possible. The Design System provides design specifications, code snippets,
  usage guidelines, and where possible, accessibility and research
  guidelines.</p class="lead-paragraph">


  ## Component and page status


  Unless otherwise noted, all components are released, stable, and ready for
  use. Beta components are new and design changes may still occur. Please
  [contact us](tech@cfpb.gov) with any questions.


  ## Help us improve this documentation


  Though we feel our components are stable and ready for use, we could use help
  improving this documentation. Where needed, we've indicated the type of help
  we'd like and where conflicts in the current documentation exist. See how to
  get started [updating this
  documentation](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/getting-started/updating-this-documentation).
