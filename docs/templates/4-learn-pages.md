  Learn page types provide focused, detailed information about a specific topic.
  These pages may contain lengthy text passages or interactive content that
  require more engagement from the user.


  This should be the page template used for most new information and content; other higher-level page templates are mostly aimed at navigating users to the right learn page.

  ##### When to use


  * When content includes long passages of text.

  * When providing comprehensive information or detail that requires extended engagement from the user.

  * Target user is primarily in a learn mindset, interested reading through a text or engaging with a document or tool in order to find out more about a given topic or find answers to specific questions.


  ##### When other options are better


  When page content covers a variety of related topics or is focused on directing users to navigate to other locations on the site or the internet.
content_guidelines: >
  Users will likely be spending more time on these page types than others since
  they will hold more content. Consider ways to visually break up the content to
  organize it and make it easier for users to skim to find the specific content
  theyâ€™re looking for.


  * The content on these pages should be centered around conveying one single idea, topic, or call to action. This is where the bulk of our content can be found.

  * Use sub-headers to group sections of content

  * Break up long paragraphs into shorter ones

  * Use bulleted lists


  ##### Area 1: Introduction


  * Choose either a text introduction or item introduction depending on whether the template is being used to house an article or post.


  ##### Area 2: Main content


  * Must contain at least 1 component.

  * Permissible components include full width body text, tables, expandables, 25/75 image and text info unit groups, grey wells.  


  ##### Area 3: Sidebar


  * Must contain at least 1 component.

  * If using both static and dynamic content, preference for dynamic content to appear above static content.
