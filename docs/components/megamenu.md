  ## Summary of [consumerfinance.gov](https://www.consumerfinance.gov) mega menu
  design principles


  1. The mega menu works everywhere.

  2. It’s equitable for all.

  3. It’s standardized.

  4. It’s focused on navigation and content.

  5. It’s a good and ever-improving experience.


  ## More detailed version of design principles


  1. Our mega menu is based on industry standards around web development and
  user expectations around interactions. The mega menu works:

    * across our supported browsers,
    * across different browser sizes (and not just device form factors),
    * across the spectrum of user ability levels or technology familiarity, and
    * in line with the standard interactions for different assistive techniques.

  2. Our mega menu is designed to be equitable and provides full navigational
  support to all users. This includes users with physical disabilities, hearing
  and visual impairments, mental disorders, cognitive disabilities, or seizure
  disorders. Our mega menu is accessible and usable by all who use assistive
  technologies regardless of what type of disability they might have or their
  percentage within our larger user base. We do not ignore the needs of the few
  to only focus on the many.


  3. Our mega menu fully aligns with the WCAG core accessibility principles
  known as POUR: every part of it is perceivable, operable, understandable, and
  robust for all users.


  4. Our mega menu is built mobile-first with semantic code to focus on the
  content and navigation elements within it. It’s designed to work with the
  interaction defaults of both JAWS and Apple VoiceOver. The visual design
  supports all of these factors and doesn’t supersede them.


  5. We maintain a good mega menu experience for our users and actively work to
  improve it. All the designers and developers in the department read, share,
  and know where to find basic information about the mega menu. We are aware of
  its guidelines, its complexities, and what traps to avoid falling into when
  modifying it. We monitor and publish our site analytics for the mega menu on a
  regular basis to make sure that we’re continually aware of how users are using
  it and able to make necessary adjustments over time as needed. We also
  usability test the mega menu with external users as a part of the monitoring
  process.


  The [consumerfinance.gov](https://www.consumerfinance.gov) website mega menu
  is composed of five verticals: Consumer Tools, Practitioner Resources, Data &
  Research, Policy & Compliance, and About Us. **The visual layout, spacing, and
  some portion of the content guidelines will change in the near future, as we
  monitor analytics information.**

  This section contains general guidelines that govern mega menu usage,
  specifically addressing recommended link limits, character counts and
  editorial guidelines.


  ### General mega menu content guidelines


  #### Maximum number of links

  Analytics review suggests that 7 links per column should be the maximum,
  assuming space on top of the menu for a section overview page.


  - Around 70% of desktop visitors to
  [consumerfinance.gov](https://www.consumerfinance.gov) have a screen height of
  768 px or more. At that screen height, 7 is the maximum number of links that
  users see before items below are cut off, assuming 5 links around 20
  characters or less with spaces, and 2 links up to 35-40 characters with
  spaces. This also assumes no extra browser chrome, such as an address or
  bookmark bar, and flush placement of browser window to top of screen.

  - Research also shows 7 is around the maximum number of items that one can
  scan and comfortably hold in short-term memory. The idea is to minimize
  cognitive load by grouping like items into categories that can be easily
  scanned and that line up with the user's mental models.

  - For a vertical with two sections, one section can have 14 links maximum, the
  other section up to 7 links maximum, given space for a featured item, which
  occupies the fourth column. (There should be no more than three main sections
  in a vertical, but it's easier for users to scan up to two.)

  - If a section of links spans two columns, the number of links should be
  evenly distributed between columns.



  ##### Link character counts

  - Links should be 20 characters or less, including spaces.

  - Two exceptions per column can be made for longer links. These longer links
  can be 30-35 characters with spaces **maximum** (e.g. “Managing someone else’s
  money”).


  #### Editorial guidelines
    - Links should be in alphabetical order and written in title case
    - Ampersands ("&") should be used in place of the word "and"
    - See previous section for link limits and character count guidance
    - Links should generally be straightforward and self-explanatory, avoiding jargon or brand names that might be difficult for users to understand
    - Links should generally go to [consumerfinance.gov](https://www.consumerfinance.gov) pages only
    - Links should reflect page titles, but don't necessarily have to duplicate them verbatim
