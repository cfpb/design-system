use_cases: >-
  ##### When to use


  * When the primary goal of the page is to encourage users to download a resource or understand the context around a document.

  * When creating a filterable list of items, document detail pages house the items within the filterable list.


  ##### When other options are better


  * When providing the full text of an article or detailed content, but not specifically focused on a document for download, use the more general Learn page template.
content_guidelines: >-
  * Page content should provide context for the document housed on the page and
  should help users get a sense of what will be in the document before the
  download it; what answers it provides, what they will learn, etc.

  * Multiple documents should only be grouped on a single page when they are different versions of a single document, or provide context for one another.


  ###### Area 1: Item introduction


  * Using the item introduction is required.


  ###### Area 2: Main content


  * At least one component is required here.


  ###### Area 3: Sidebar


  * Strongly recommend using the metadata sidebar component in order to display basic information about the document(s) housed on this page.

  * When the metadata sidebar is used, it must appear at the top of the sidebar area.


  ##### Post preview


  * Function of the post preview is to provide context to the user to help them decide if the document has the information they need as they browse through a list.

  * May use up to two category labels, but strongly recommended to assign one category label per page.

  * Post preview title will be linked, so no need to provide “Click here to read more” direct call to action, or link to the doc detail page within the preview description text.

  * Post preview description text should be limited to 2-3 sentences; 50 words. Language should provide a “nudge” to action.
