  Learn page types provide focused, detailed information about a specific topic.
  These pages may contain lengthy text passages or interactive content that
  require more engagement from the user.


  This should be the page template used for most new information and content;
  other higher-level page templates are mostly aimed at navigating users to the
  right learn page.


  This page is under active development. Information is being moved into it from
  these pages:

  #### Use cases


  ##### When to use


  * When content includes long passages of text.

  * When providing comprehensive information or detail that requires extended
  engagement from the user.

  * Target user is primarily in a learn mindset, interested reading through a
  text or engaging with a document or tool in order to find out more about a
  given topic or find answers to specific questions.


  ##### When other options are better


  When page content covers a variety of related topics or is focused on
  directing users to navigate to other locations on the site or the internet.


  #### Content guidelines

  Users will likely be spending more time on these page types than others since
  they will hold more content. Consider ways to visually break up the content to
  organize it and make it easier for users to skim to find the specific content
  theyâ€™re looking for.


  * The content on these pages should be centered around conveying one single
  idea, topic, or call to action. This is where the bulk of our content can be
  found.

  * Use sub-headers to group sections of content

  * Break up long paragraphs into shorter ones

  * Use bulleted lists

  * Requirements: At least one component in each main content area.

  * Choose either a text introduction or item introduction depending on whether
  the template is being used to house an article or post.
