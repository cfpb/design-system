  These are the strategic underpinnings for the CFPB’s design and development
  standards. They should serve as the backbone for the user experience, ensuring
  that the standards we set enable products that are easy to use and understand
  for consumers.

  ### Public service, public trust

  #### Honest, transparent design that wins the public’s trust.

  We establish trust through clear, concise, and approachable design that is
  always consumer-driven. We demonstrate transparency through our user-friendly
  online experiences and tools and our dedication to open-source content.

  ### Give the user control

  #### Design to empower users with information.

  The CFPB motivates consumers to take the control of their financial
  decision-making; our designs enable this process. Good design increases
  transparency and succinctly hands the user all the necessary information,
  giving consumers control of how they use it. Designers must rely on
  introspection and research to discover what path users instinctively take and
  then cater to those instincts.

  ### Aesthetic integrity

  #### Align appearance with purpose.

  Aesthetic integrity is not merely “attractiveness;” it implies the successful
  integration of design and function. Appearance should align with purpose.
  Using clear and intuitive design creates a trustworthy tone and a powerful
  platform for supporting the CFPB’s mission.

  #### Maintain consistency and clarity.

  Maintaining consistency in design empowers users to seamlessly transfer their
  knowledge and skills from one product to another. Focusing on consistency
  helps uphold aesthetic integrity.

  ### Design with data

  #### Design gives voice to data, and data informs design.

  Because the CFPB is a data-driven organization, quantitative measures of
  success should be integral to the design process. Design should incorporate
  data to aid understanding of complex issues, and data-driven feedback should
  influence the design process. Succinct and compelling visualization of
  information gives data a voice and helps us clarify otherwise indigestible
  numbers.

  ### Inclusion and accessibility

  #### Design for the widest possible demographic with bias toward clear
  articulation, plain language, and intuitive design.

  We design to meet each consumer where he or she is. We are sensitive to
  experiential level, timing, and biases and aim to design experiences that are
  equally accessible to everyone, and equally empowering no matter what the
  user’s skill set or familiarity. Simple, clean designs are the most effective
  and wide-reaching.

  ### Coherent end-to-end user experience

  #### Unify parts of the user experience and transition seamlessly between
  them.

  The best design guides the user’s experience from beginning-to-end and caters
  to his or her expectations. Navigation between sections should be intuitive
  and transitions should be seamless. Consistent quality and attention to detail
  are essential to maintain a cohesive user experience.
