  biases](#identify-lived-experiences-and-biases)


  [Investigate internalized oppression](#investigate-internalized-oppression)


  [Use bias-free, person-centered
  language](#use-bias-free-person-centered-language)

  [Assemble diverse teams](#assemble-diverse-teams)


  ### Identify lived experiences and biases


  Bias is the tendency to allow personal opinions and past experiences to
  influence one’s judgment. Many of these biases may be unconscious, but they
  are none the less damaging to others. They are often based on false
  stereotypes about a particular group. It’s part of the human condition to rely
  on these cognitive shortcuts and to assume others think like us or have
  similar values, opinions, and beliefs.\ 


  Bias can skew our research and design activities, whether in our choice of
  who participates, what information is collected, or how information is
  interpreted. Awareness of our biases is key to mitigating against them, and
  that’s where the frames of reference exercise can be particularly valuable.

  <div class =\"eyebrow\">{% include icons/edit.svg %} Activity</div>


  <h4 class=\"h3\" id=\"frames-of-reference\">Frames of reference</h4>\ 


  Adapted from 18F’s [presentation on equity-centered design and
  research](https://digital.gov/files/equity-centered-design-revised.pptx)


  As a team, run through this activity to identify your individual and
  collective biases before beginning research or design activities. If possible,
  couple the exercise with a review of what you have learned about the audience.
  \ 


  Everyone should choose how they want to participate, but ideally this can be
  a group activity.


  <b>1. Ahead of the activity, add the following prompts to an online
  collaboration tool set to private mode (or a setting that allows for anonymous
  contribution).</b> Organize the prompts so all participants have enough room
  to add their responses. (More prompts can be found in 18F’s [frames of
  reference
  form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScI0iTQEstjECMzFVuyMt0Giku69Yg\
  gEkAlybQPlH4y7Ik9Vg/viewform).)\ 


  <div class=\"content-50 content-first\" markdown=\"1\">


  * Types of locations where you’ve lived (e.g. urban, rural)

  * Typical internet speed (high speed, cellular only)

  * Typical equipment used to access the internet (desktop or laptop computer,
  or mobile device only)\ 

  * Race & ethnicity\ 

  * Gender & sexual identity\ 

  * Age\ 

  * Food insecurity\ 

  * Housing insecurity\ 


  </div>


  <div class=\"content-50 content-last\" markdown=\"1\">


  * Immigration status, or whether you’ve ever lived with an immigrant\ 

  * Languages spoken \ 

  * Familiarity with physical & mental disabilities \ 

  * Use of assistive technologies\ 

  * Marital and parental status\ 

  * Where you grew up\ 

  * Your values\ 

  * Your organization’s values  \ 


  </div>


  <b>2. During the collaboration session, ask the team to spend a few minutes
  privately noting their own personal, lived experiences in response to each of
  these prompts.</b>


  <b>3﻿. If the team wants to share their findings: </b>


  * Ask participants to add their findings anonymously to the collaboration
  tool. Emphasize that participants should choose how they wish to participate
  in this activity.

  * As a team, gather and organize the anonymized responses. Group them and
  identify themes. Ask participants what they noticed as they were doing this
  exercise. Was anything missing? Was anything surprising? For example, if
  everyone on the team lives in an urban environment, this exercise can help
  prompt awareness and discussion of the needs of people living in more rural
  areas.\ 


  <b>I﻿f the team wants to keep their findings private:</b>


  * … and this is a new team: Discuss the prompts at a higher level, perhaps
  focusing on the agency mission and possible gaps in the team’s lived
  experience. For example, the team could spend more time drawing attention to
  gaps in internet speed and equipment, food and housing insecurity, and/or the
  needs of people with disabilities.\ 

  * … and the team is doing this exercise when beginning a project: Use a
  project-focused lens to run this exercise and discuss the prompts at a higher
  level.\ 


  \  * What biases could come into play in this particular project?

  \  * Do any of us have any lived experience that would help us in planning
  this project?

  * The [positionality
  wheel](https://design.ncsu.edu/blog/2022/01/07/from-a-to-z-lesley-ann-noel-an\
  d-decolonizing-design/) is another form of the Frames of Reference exercise.\ 

  * The Decision Lab has a [list of the most relevant cognitive biases in
  behavioral economics](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases), which can be applied
  to our own biases as designers and researchers, but also participants.\ 

  * Nielsen Norman Group has several resources pertaining to bias in UX. Watch
  their video, [Decision Biases Affecting UX
  Practitioners](https\\://www.nngroup.com/videos/decision-biases-ux-practition\
  ers/), to learn how to mitigate your own biases. \ 


  ### Investigate internalized oppression


  We encourage everyone to read widely to examine their own identity and
  internalized oppression—the false narratives or stereotypes that they may have
  internalized about themselves, and how they might perpetuate systemic
  oppression.\ 


  <div class=\"eyebrow\">{% include icons/book.svg %} F﻿urther reading</div>


  For more information, Intentional Futures has a useful explanation of
  systemic oppression and how it manifests in their [Introduction to
  Equity-Centered
  Design](https://www.intentionalfutures.com/public/ecd-booklet.pdf).
  Additionally, consider using the [implicit bias test put together by
  Harvard](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/user/agg/blindspot/indexrk.htm\
  ), which is designed to identify unconscious positive and negative
  associations based on race.\ 


  ### Use bias-free, person-centered language


  It’s important to use clear, respectful, inclusive language that’s free of
  stereotypes and generalizations. Our words matter, whether we’re addressing
  the general public or a fellow team member. Follow the guidelines below:\ 


  <b>Ensure the terms and references you use to refer to a group are both
  respectful and accurate.</b><br>

  Some terms may not be accurate to describe a group, while other terms can
  have negative connotations. For example, as [18F points out, the term
  “American Indians and Alaskan Natives” is not an all-encompassing term for
  Indigenous
  Americans](https://github.com/18F/Equity-centered-design-with-American-Indian\
  s-and-Alaska-Natives-10x/wiki/Intro-Why-Equity-Centered-Design#words-that-car\
  ry-weight), as it does not include members of non-federally-recognized tribes,
  or Indigenous Americans who are not members of a tribe.\ 


  Use the terminology that groups and individuals use for themselves. This
  includes the gender pronouns of any individuals you work with directly. Do
  your research, read the resources listed in the “Further Reading” section
  below, and ask members of the group in question directly if you’re in doubt.
  \ 


  <b>Use people-first language.</b><br>

  [People-first
  language](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-languag\
  e/disability) is a way to respectfully acknowledge the humanity of an
  individual or group first, rather than the identity or condition they may
  experience. Examples of people-first language include “people with a mental
  disorder”, rather than calling someone “mentally ill”, or referring to someone
  as a “person without housing”, rather than as a “homeless person”. The
  specific terms preferred by an individual or group can vary, and do not always
  include people-first syntax; additionally, language is always changing. Refer
  to the resources in the “Further Reading” section below to better understand
  how to use people-first language, and always ask people directly how they wish
  to define themselves. \ 


  <b>Consider avoiding the word “user” when referring to the people we
  serve.</b><br>\ 

  In line with using people-first language, consider using the word “people”
  instead of “user” when referring to those we’re trying to help. “User” can
  depersonalize our intended audience, potentially reducing them to a
  one-dimensional data point. “People”, in contrast, acknowledges the many
  distinct individuals who are interacting with the services we create for them,
  and helps us think collectively about the multiplicity of their viewpoints and
  lived experiences. \

  <h4 class=\"h3\">﻿Set intentional language</h4>


  Take time during your team formation and when beginning a new project to
  review the guidelines and references above. [APA’s Bias Free Language
  Guide](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language)
  and [Language, Please](https://languageplease.org/) are both excellent guides
  to inclusive language, and contain robust lists of appropriate person- and
  identity- first terms. Discuss this guidance as a team and come to a shared
  understanding of language to use.  \ 


  </div>


  <br>


  ### Establish team values\ 


  \r

  Discussing and documenting your team values will enable your group to create
  a shared understanding of how you want to work together and why you’re making
  those choices. Revisit your team values throughout your work to stay grounded
  in your intentions.  \r

  \r


  <div class=\"o-well\" markdown=\"1\">


  <div class=\"eyebrow\">{% include icons/edit.svg %} Activity</div>


  <h4 class=\"h3\">Create a set of equity-centered team values</h4>


  \r

  For newly established teams, create team values that incorporate the results
  of both the frames of reference and intentional language exercises above. An
  example of team values could include, embracing discomfort, vulnerability, the
  awareness that we do not know everything, and understanding that just because
  we have not experienced something does not make it untrue.


  \r

  \r

  Once you’ve created your team values, find opportunities to regularly review
  your values as a team. For example, read these values during your sprint
  planning ceremonies.\r


  </div>

  <br>


  ### Assemble diverse teams

  \r

  \r

  Organizational leaders and managers should prioritize assembling teams with
  a diversity of lived experiences. Diversity is broad; it is the practice or
  quality of including or involving people from a range of different social and
  ethnic backgrounds.\ 


  While this includes individuals of different races, genders, religions,
  sexual orientations, etc., it also includes individuals of different economic,
  geographic, or other backgrounds. In a diverse environment, every person has
  different knowledge, perspectives, and points of view that help us make better
  informed decisions. Assembling a diverse team can be informed by individual
  teams running the [frames of reference](#frames-of-reference) activity and
  giving input to their leaders. \r


  ## Beginning a project


  \r

  \r

  [Understand the project’s value](#understand-the-projects-value)

  \r

  [Learn how power structures can affect the people you
  serve](#learn-how-power-structures-can-affect-the-people-you-serve)

  \r

  [Examine your biases in the context of the
  project](#examine-your-biases-in-the-context-of-the-project)

  \r

  [Apply trauma-informed principles](#apply-trauma-informed-principles)\r


  ### Understand the project’s value


  \r

  \r

  Before a project begins, come to a shared understanding of its value—that
  is, a clear sense of the intended outcomes and value that key decision-makers
  envision creating. This is necessary to truly understand how the project might
  impact the audience.\r



  <div class=\"o-well\" markdown=\"1\">


  <div class=\"eyebrow\">{% include icons/edit.svg %} Activity</div>


  <h4 class=\"h3\">Write a problem statement</h4>


  Before engaging in any work, stakeholders and the project team should work
  together to create a problem statement identifying and framing the problem to
  explore through research or solve through design. Nielsen Norman has more
  about [how to form a problem
  statement](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/problem-statements/). 18F also has
  a [design hypothesis
  exercise](https://methods.18f.gov/decide/design-hypothesis/) that considers
  the value and impact of work on the intended audience.\ 


  \r

  \r

  The team should also engage in [activities to validate the problem
  statement](https://methods.18f.gov/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/)
  once it’s been formed.   \r


  </div>\ 


  <br>


  ### Learn how power structures can affect the people you serve


  \r

  \r

  \r

  <b>If your product is for an underserved or underrepresented community, do
  some research.</b>

  \r

  * Research from a reliable source the community’s current and historical
  relationship with the government, along with an awareness of their history. \r

  * Investigate any injustices the community has faced at the hands of the
  government and any historic mistrust that has resulted. \r

  * Take time to learn about the regulations and/or policies currently in
  place which might affect the people and communities for who you are designing.
  Dig in to learn about how those policies evolved to be what they are today. \r

  * Explore any tension that might impact how you are perceived as a
  representative of the Federal government when engaging with these
  communities.\ 


  \r

  \r

  As 18F points out in their [presentation on equity-centered design and
  research](https://digital.gov/files/equity-centered-design-revised.pptx),
  people often access government services in their most vulnerable moments.
  Recognize the power imbalance between being a representative of the Federal
  government and the people we serve. \ 


  \r

  \r

  Engage with the broader community (other government agencies, nonprofits,
  grassroots organizations, or other groups working on a community level) to
  seek out knowledge and additional perspectives.  \r


  {% include icons/star.svg %} <b>Outside of your project work,</b> make
  efforts to educate yourself, your team, and your leadership. Start up a book
  club and develop a reading list for people to read at their own pace.\ 


  <div class=\"o-well\" markdown=\"1\">

  <div class=\"eyebrow\">{% include icons/edit.svg %} Activity</div>

  \r

  \r

  <h4 class=\"h3\">Conduct research as a team</h4>\ 


  \r

  \r

  As a team, divide up avenues to learn about the power structures, systems,
  and policymaking impacting the community for whom you’re designing. \r

  \r


  Plan a time to discuss what you learned and which sources you found
  valuable. \r

  \r


  </div>


  <br>


  ### Examine your biases in the context of the project


  \r

  \r

  During team formation, you should have spent time uncovering your biases and
  lived experiences. Take time to do the frames of reference activity again as a
  team, taking into consideration the context of the project you’re beginning.
  Couple the activity with a review of what you’ve learned about the audience
  for whom you’ll be designing.\r

  \r


  ### Apply trauma-informed principles\r

  \r

  Trauma is an event, a series of events, or a set of circumstances
  experienced by an individual or group as emotionally or physically harmful,
  and that has lasting effects on their sense of well-being. The trauma-informed
  approach aims to avoid re-traumatization of a person during the course of your
  work. \r

  \r

  People are not defined by their demographics or behaviors alone. Consider
  what events and circumstances may be impacting someone, especially when you
  know you need to work with vulnerable individuals or communities. \r


  {% include icons/star.svg %} <b>Ready to conduct research for your
  project?</b> Learn how to recognize and respond to trauma during a research
  session.\ 


  #### Create a safe space for your team.\r

  \r

  It is possible that you and your team may experience second-hand trauma
  during a project. Sometimes called vicarious trauma, it’s when people have
  prolonged exposure to victims of trauma or sensitive topics related to
  traumatic experiences. [Learn about the signs for vicarious
  trauma](https://ovc.ojp.gov/program/vtt/what-is-vicarious-trauma#what-are-som\
  e-common-negative-reactions-to-vicarious-trauma) and make space to talk about
  how the work may be affecting the team. If you see someone on your team
  exhibiting signs of vicarious trauma, [there are several steps you can
  take](https://ovc.ojp.gov/program/vtt/what-is-vicarious-trauma#suggestions-fo\
  r-coworkers). \r
