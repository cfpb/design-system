  ### Required vs. optional fields

  Where possible, design your forms to only include required fields. If it’s not required, ask yourself if it’s really necessary to include at all. Add instructions at the top of the form to clearly indicate that all fields are required unless otherwise noted. If a field is optional, indicate it with inline helper text, as shown above. Don’t indicate which fields are required; that would only introduce redundant visual noise.


  Try not to design forms consisting mainly of optional fields. If you must do so, mark required field labels only with inline helper text.

accessibility: For screen reader accessibility, consider using the
  `aria-describedby` attribute for helper text, which gives screen readers users
  the information if they need while allowing more flexibility with placement.
