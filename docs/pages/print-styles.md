  As some [consumerfinance.gov](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/) users may want
  to print pages on our site, we’ve set up print styles to ensure pages present
  well when printed and use minimal ink and paper. The following print styles
  have been applied across
  [consumerfinance.gov](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/) pages.  


  ## Hide web-only elements


  We hide header, footer, and left-hand navigation links as well as web-specific patterns such as our email signup box, feedback module, search bar, and video player buttons.  


  ## Display URLs


  URLs for links, buttons, and videos display when printed. This ensures a user can access the linked content if desired. Visit  [Links](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/components/links) and [Buttons](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/components/buttons) for specifications.  


  ## Display images and content in a succinct layout 


  Patterns such as [info unit groups](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/patterns/info-unit-groups) and [featured content modules](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/patterns/featured-content-module) print in their large-screen layouts. Printing patterns in this format enables multi-column layouts with readable line lengths and reasonably sized images.  


  ## Prioritize content


  A page’s sidebar drops to the bottom of the page when printed.


  ## Present readable line lengths


  For pages with single-column layouts, column width is reduced when printed to ensure readable line lengths on paper. Whereas as a reader may have control over aspects such as browser width and text size in a digital setting, they do not have this control when reading a printed piece, so it’s important that line lengths are as readable as possible. See the section "Line lengths" on the [Fonts](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/foundation/fonts) page for more information.
