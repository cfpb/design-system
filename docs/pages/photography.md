  Photography is an important tool that helps us relate to consumers,
  communicate empathy, and build trust. CFPB images should preserve aesthetic
  integrity: photographs should never be stretched, free of special effects, and
  always in full color. Images should be relatable, natural, and shot in a real
  location.

  ### Treatment


  Photographs should not be collaged, staged, unrealistic, or use still lifes to illustrate concepts. Image manipulation should be limited to adjusting levels, contrast, and natural color balance.

  ### Include text alternatives for non-text content


  For any content that is not text-based (images, audio, video, animations, charts, graphs, etc), provide an alternative version of that content that is text-based.


  * Use the `alt` and `title` attributes on images and other graphical elements.

  * Include descriptive text near images (for example, a pie chart legend with percentages of each item).
