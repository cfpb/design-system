  ### Content guidelines

  - Content in info units should be succinct. Do not use info units for multiple paragraphs of copy. 

  - In addition to being able to give each info unit a heading and description, you may optionally give the info unit group a heading and introduction paragraph. 

  - Each info unit type may use an H2, H3, or H4 heading depending on where the info unit sits within the page's heading hierarchy. 


  #### 25/75 info unit


  - Heading: Maximum 60 characters 

  - Description: Maximum 275 characters 

  - Call to action: Maximum 65 characters


  #### 50/50 info unit

  Ideally, use an even number of 50/50 info units as a group. The content in each info unit should be roughly the same number of lines if possible. 

  - Heading: Maximum 30 characters

  - Description: If including an image, maximum 130 characters. If not including an image, maximum 250 characters. 

  - Call to action: Maximum 40 characters


  #### 33/33/33 info unit

  Ideally, group 33/33/33 info units in multiples of three (3, 6, 9, etc.). The content in each info unit should be roughly the same number of lines if possible. 

  - Heading: Maximum 30 characters

  - Description: Maximum 130 characters (previously 90-150)

  - Call to action: Maximum 40 characters


  ### Image guidelines

  Images can be illustrations or photos. 


  #### 25/75 info unit

  - Image required

  - Must be a 1:1 ratio

  - Can be a square or circle crop


  #### 50/50 info unit

  - Image optional

  - Can be a 1:1 or 16:9 ratio


  #### 33/33/33 info unit

  - Image optional

  - Must be a 1:1 ratio

  - Can be a square or circle crop


  ### Stylistic guidelines

  - Option to include a rule above an info unit group to separate it from the previous section on the page

  - Option to include a rule between rows of info units (or between each info unit in - If an info unit group contains both an image and a call-to-action link, option to have the image link to the call-to-action URL. If there are multiple call-to-action links, the image will link to the first link.
eyebrow: Main content
title: Info unit groups
description: "Info unit groups are used to draw a userâ€™s eye to key information
  on a page. An info unit can contain an image, brief description, and
  call-to-action link to lead a user to additional content on a child or sibling
  page. "
use_cases: >-
  ### When to use

  - When a call-to-action link, leading users to a deeper page in the section, needs a visual highlight on the page

  - When an image or illustration helps users better understand the purpose of content

  - To help establish a hierarchy of linked content on a page

  - For brief content


  ### When other options are better

  - When there are multiple paragraphs of copy
behavior: "All info units stack to one column at small screen size. "
