The CFPB strives to better serve consumers by using plain language; relying on simple, user-friendly design; and providing easy access to information that can help consumers make informed decisions.

This Design Manual is an open-source resource for CFPB staff to produce effective and visually-consistent products that are easy for consumers to access, use, and understand. The Manual includes our design principles, guidelines for user experience, visual identity standards, and code snippets for common user interface elements. The Manual will continue to evolve as we learn what works best for the CFPB and the people we serve.

## Help us make improvements

We have designed the Manual to be open for the public, which allows you to help us make improvements by [filing an issue](https://github.com/cfpb/design-manual/issues?milestone=&page=1&state=open) or [submitting a pull request](https://github.com/cfpb/design-manual/pulls) on GitHub. Not on GitHub? Email us your suggestions at [tech@consumerfinance.gov](tech@consumerfinance.gov).

All content has been released as open source under the CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication, and weâ€™d love for other agencies, developers, or groups to adapt it for their own use.

## Other Resources

We are proud to join the community of organizations that have made their design standards public, such as [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/), the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/gel), and the UK's [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual). We hope our design manual can serve as a foundation for discussing and practicing user-centered design in government.
