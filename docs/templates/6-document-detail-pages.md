  Document detail page types provide summary information about a document or
  related group of documents. These pages help users better understand the
  relevancy and context of documents before deciding whether or not to download
  or engage further.


  This page is under active development. Information is being moved into it from
  this page:

  #### Use cases


  ##### When to use


  * When the primary goal of the page is to encourage users to download a
  resource or understand the context around a document.

  * When creating a filterable list of items, document detail pages house the
  items within the filterable list.


  ##### When other options are better


  * When providing the full text of an article or detailed content, but not
  specifically focused on a document for download, use the more general Learn
  page template.


  #### Content guidelines


  ##### Document detail page


  * Page content should provide context for the document housed on the page and
  should help users get a sense of what will be in the document before the
  download it; what answers it provides, what they will learn, etc.

  * Multiple documents should only be grouped on a single page when they are
  different versions of a single document, or provide context for one another.


  ###### Area 1: Item introduction


  * Using the item introduction is required.


  ###### Area 2: Main content


  * At least one component is required here.


  ###### Area 3: Sidebar


  * Strongly recommend using the metadata sidebar component in order to display
  basic information about the document(s) housed on this page.

  * When the metadata sidebar is used, it must appear at the top of the sidebar
  area.


  ##### Post preview


  * Function of the post preview is to provide context to the user to help them
  decide if the document has the information they need as they browse through a
  list.

  * May use up to two category labels, but strongly recommended to assign one
  category label per page.

  * Post preview title will be linked, so no need to provide “Click here to read
  more” direct call to action, or link to the doc detail page within the preview
  description text.

  * Post preview description text should be limited to 2-3 sentences; 50 words.
  Language should provide a “nudge” to action.
