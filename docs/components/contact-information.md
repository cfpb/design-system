  <h3>Use cases</h3>


  * When there is a specific action users may want or need to take that requires
  contacting a specific office within the Bureau.

  * Default placement should be in the sidebar, use main content area when
  contact information is of extra significance or directly ties into the main
  objective of the page.


  #### When something else is better


  * When no contact information is needed or no specific action is tied to the
  contact information.


  <h3>Content guidelines</h3>


  Headings should be the official name of the office.


  Description beneath heading should clearly state why a user would need to
  contact the office. This description should closely follow the office
  descriptions linked through the bureau structure page. About 2-3 sentences in
  length (150-300 characters).


  Email address should always be formatted as @consumerfinance.gov, not
  @cfpb.gov. (Addresses are automatically redirected, no technical work is
  necessary to support this standard.)


  Mailing address:


  * Street suffixes (street, place, avenue, etc.) should be spelled out.

  * Cardinal directions (NW, SW, NE, SE, N, E, S, W) should be title case with
  no periods, and come after a comma.

  * Washington, D.C. has a comma and periods in D.C.


  Notes:


  * Pre-set contact options are email, phone number (including TTY/TDD), fax,
  and physical addresses.

  * Sidebar pattern includes the option for map imagery.

  * Pre-set minicons are used to help visually reinforce the type of contact
  method.


  #### Behavior

  main content area or the sidebar:
