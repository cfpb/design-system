            'title': 'Accessibility',
            'description': "The following four principles, as defined by the W3C®, lay the foundation for ensuring that web content is available for all users, including users with disabilities and users on non-desktop devices. They also enable future compatibility in the event that future devices are radically different from those in use today.\n\n\n  Perceivable\n  Operable\n  Understandable\n  Robust\n\n\nNote: While this document can function as a checklist – and at times, it will – that isn’t the primary purpose. The goal is to foster understanding of why these guidelines are important.\n\nThis guide is adapted from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, a W3C Recommendation. More info.\n\nPerceivable\n\n(View on W3C site)\n\nInformation and user interface elements must be presented to users in ways that they can perceive. This includes considering individuals using assistive technology (e.g., screen readers for blind users or captions for deaf users) and the limitations of different devices (e.g., grayscale screens or muted mobile devices).\n\nInclude text alternatives for non-text content\n\nFor any content that is not text-based (images, audio, video, animations, charts, graphs, etc), provide an alternative version of that content that is text-based.\n\n\n  Use the alt and title attributes on images and other graphical elements.\n  Use the &lt;title&gt; and &lt;desc&gt; elements in SVG drawings.\n  Use fallback text for the &lt;object&gt; element.\n  Include descriptive text near images (for example, a pie chart legend with percentages of each item).\n  Provide transcripts of audio and video recordings.\n  Provide alternatives for multimedia\n  Multimedia such as audio, video, and animations will usually require more than just descriptive text. In most cases, the timing of text and descriptions in these files is important and should therefore be incorporated in an accessible manner.\n\n\nPrerecorded content\n\n\n  For audio-only content, provide a transcript of both spoken words and descriptions of other sounds.\n  For video-only content, provide an audio track or transcript that describes the video.\n  Combined audio and video content should accommodate alternatives for both (e.g., closed captioning or sign interpretation for audio, and an audio track or a screenplay-like document that transcribes dialog and descriptions of sounds and action for video).\n\n\nLive content\n\n\n  Closed captioning or sign language interpretation should always be available, but in some cases providing the prepared remarks or script alongside the audio/video may suffice.\n\n\nOrganize content semantically\n\nSemantic content allows user agents to correctly parse documents and present it to end users in a way that is appropriate for their device and medium without losing information or structure.\n\n\n  Use semantic HTML, including relative header tags, lists, and semantic tags like &lt;aside&gt;, and &lt;figure&gt;\n  Support HTML tables with semantic tags like &lt;th&gt;, &lt;thead&gt;, &lt;tbody&gt;, and &lt;caption&gt;\n  Mark up HTML forms with semantic tags like &lt;label&gt;, &lt;fieldset&gt;, &lt;legend&gt;, and – where appropriate – HTML5 form additions like email fields.\n  If the sequence of a page matters, the underlying HTML document should be in that order or the sequence should be machine-readable through another method.\n  Avoid text descriptions that rely on layout or other sensory items such as “click the round button” or “the image on the right.” However, note that “above” and “below” are generally understood to mean “preceding” and “after,” and as such are permissible usage.\n\n\nMake content easily distinguishable from its surroundings\n\nThese guidelines help ensure that content is perceivable for sighted users.\n\nText\n\n\n  Choose easy-to-read fonts.\n  Avoid using images of text, except for logos and images meant to represent physical documents.\n  Text should be able to be resized up to 200% without causing overlapping issues with other content on the page. Don’t rely on browser zoom, since some users have settings to force large type.\n\n\nColor\n\n\n  Do not use color as the only means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.\n  \n    Text should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5 : 1, but there are exceptions.\n\n    \n      For large text, a contrast ratio of only 3 : 1 is necessary. Large regular text is at least 18pt/24px, while large bold text is 14pt/18px.\n      Text or images of text that are either pure decoration or not visible, or are part of a logo, picture that contains significant other visual content, or inactive UI components (like disabled form controls) do not have a color contrast requirement.\n    \n  \n  The Color Contrast Checker is a good tool for testing color contrast ratios.\n\n\nAudio\n\n\n  Avoid auto-playing audio. If this is absolutely unavoidable, provide a control that allows the user to stop the audio and adjust or mute the volume.\n  In recorded audio, background sounds should be at least 20 dB lower than foreground sounds and speech. This does not apply to music.\n\n\nOperable\n\n(view on W3C site)\n\nUser interface components and navigation must be operable: an interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform. Following these guidelines will guarantee that all users can navigate a website or app regardless of their input device (mouse, keyboard, touchscreen, screen reader, etc).\n\nEnsure that all content is keyboard accessible\n\nIn general, if a website can be operated using only the keyboard, it will also be operable with less-common input devices.\n\n\n  All controls must be addressable by the keyboard. By default, this includes &lt;a&gt;, &lt;area&gt;, &lt;object&gt;, and all form elements. Other elements can be made addressable by applying a tabindex value.\n  Avoid keyboard traps. If a user can tab to an element on the page, the user needs to be able to exit that element using only the keyboard as well.\n  Do not rely on specific timing of individual keystrokes when implementing keyboard accessibility.\n\n\nGive users ample time to interact with content\n\nYou should not use time limits. For cases in which time limits are unavoidable:\n\n\n  Allow users to turn off or extend the time limit to at least 10 times the default setting.\n  Warn users at least 20 seconds before a time limit expires and enable a time extension with a simple action, such as pressing the space bar.\n  If a user needs to log in again after a time limit, make sure that there is no loss of data.\n\n\nAvoid interrupting users\n\n\n  Avoid popups or other modal dialogs that haven not been prompted by explicit user action or are alerting the user about something that is time-sensitive.\n  Allow users to pause, stop, or hide anything moving, blinking, or scrolling on the screen if the motion lasts longer than 5 seconds.\n  Allow users to pause, stop, hide, or control the frequency of auto-updating information.\n\n\nDo not create designs or interactions that may cause seizures\n\nNothing on the page should flash more than 3 times in 1 second.\n\nHelp users navigate, find content, and determine where they are\n\n\n  Allow users to bypass blocks of content that appear repeatedly on a website, like navigation, with a “skip to main content” or similar link.\n  Use titles that describe a webpage’s topic or purpose.\n  Include descriptive section headings to organize content.\n  Unless content is a step in a process, provide more than one way to access it, such as through browsing and search.\n  Provide a breadcrumb trail or other way for the user to identify their location in the site on every page.\n  Use descriptive link text. Avoid calls to action like “click here” or “read more.”\n\n\nManage focus\n\nWhen users navigate a webpage using the keyboard or another alternative input device, only one element on the page will be in focus at a given time.\n\n\n  If the order of controls on a page matters, make sure they will be focused in that order when navigating by keyboard.\n  Make sure there is a visible indicator on screen of which element has focus. This may be an optional mode, but it should be turned on if the user begins to navigate with the keyboard.\n  If a user action causes a modal dialog to appear on screen, make sure the focus is moved to that dialog or area. When the dialog is dismissed, re-focus back to the original control or to some other logical place in the document.\n\n\nUnderstandable\n\n(view on W3C site)\n\nUsers must be able to comprehend content and how to operate an interface.\n\nCreate text content that is machine- and human-readable\n\n\n  Specify the language of the content in a machine-readable way. Generally, this means using &lt;html lang=\"en-us\"&gt; or the equivalent for another language. This will help with translation software and ensures that screen readers will use the correct pronunciation.\n  If part of a document is in a different language from the overall language of the document, specify this with something like &lt;span lang=\"fr\"&gt;.\n  Where possible, provide a way for users to find definitions of unusual words and phrases, especially jargon.\n  Make the meaning of abbreviations and acronyms available, either directly in the text, such as “Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)”, or in a machine-readable way, like &lt;abbr title=\"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\"&gt;CFPB&lt;/abbr&gt;).\n  Write text to an eighth-grade comprehension level, excluding proper names and titles, where possible. If that is not an option, provide a simplified version of the text nearby.\n  For hard-to-pronounce words, consider including the pronunciation.\n\n\nDevelop sites that behave in a predictable way\n\n\n  Related webpages should have a consistent navigation structure and layout.\n  Components that perform the same action should be labelled the same way.\n\n\nMaintain context\n\nAvoid changing a user’s context without an explicit request from the user, like clicking a button. If an automatic context change is necessary, warn the user in advance, and give them an opportunity to stop it.\n\nA few examples of context changes:\n\n\n  Submitting a form\n  Moving focus to a different element\n  Popping open a help dialog box\n  Launching a new window\n  Following a link\n  Reloading most of the content on a page\n\n\nRobust\n\n(View on W3C site)\n\nContent must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. A robust site will be broadly compatible with past, current, and future web browsers and devices.\n\nFollow standard web best practices\n\nThis means using standard HTML markup. If complex widgets are required, use WAI-ARIA to make the use, states, and properties clear to browsers and assistive technologies.\n\n\n  Make sure your HTML validates.\n  Use unique IDs on individual pages.\n  Avoid deprecated or proprietary markup.\n  Make sure states and properties of elements are machine readable.\n\n\nNote that this is specific to HTML and does not include CSS.\n",

Using transparency increases the strength of the beam metaphor. Transparency should be achieved through opacity, not blending modes like multiply / darken / etc.\n\n\n\n  Composition Beam patterns are composed of overlapping beams that frame areas of white space used for titles, text, and other graphic elements. Beams always point horizontally, not vertically.\n\n\n\n  Ideal composition\n  Solid green beam bleeds off the top of the layout. Beams alternate direction to create layered beam shapes.\n\n\n  \n\n\n  Ideal composition\n  Layered beams anchor to the bottom, leaving plenty of white space above for type. This works especially well for horizontal layouts.\n\n\n  \n\n\n  {% include icons/error-round.svg %} Poor composition\n  Beams float in white space, leaving little room for content.

For instance, an open text field for “state” could be entered as Missouri or MO. So if this needs to be standardized, a dropdown facilitates this standardization.\n  The list options are familiar to the user. A dropdown is not a good place to introduce new or complicated terms or concepts. For instance, if the question is “What’s your favorite color of the rainbow,” a dropdown could be a good choice. The options are familiar and there are more than six. You don’t want the user to have to read and absorb a lot of new information in a dropdown.\n\n",

The default components are a poor choice for the visually impaired. If a multi-select component is desired, use custom JavaScript to make it accessible.\n",

They are meant to call attention to a related piece of content that might be new or otherwise relevant to — but not directly a part of — the main content on the page, the primary intended user action, or the user journey.\n\nThe goal of an FCM is to have the user do one of three things: learn something (usually by navigating to other content), watch something, or download something (a printable tool or resource). FCMs can appear on any page type, though they are best suited for pages third level and below in the site map.\n\nFCM content shouldn’t be seen as integral to the page, meaning it could be changed or removed without taking away vital information the user needs or interrupting the user journey. Therefore, this module is not intended to support the site IA as the primary, permanent location for content. When the content is an integral, long-term part of the intended user journey, then it should have a more permanent home on the page.\n\nUse a featured content module (FCM) when you want to highlight something that’s:\n\n\n  Timely: Highlights a new tool or development. Keep in mind: When you remove dated content from a FCM, make sure you’re not getting rid of the only way users can navigate to it. Make sure to plan a permanent home for the content.\n  Impactful: Lets people know immediately how the content will affect them, how they can use it, and how it might enhance their understanding of — or experience with — the primary page content.\n  Localized: New content that specifically applies to people in a specific geographic area; it may be important for that audience to see their specific content first, and when it’s removed from the page it won’t disrupt the usual user flow.\n  Unique: Content that is specifically in the Bureau’s “wheelhouse” because of our position as an approachable, trusted, unbiased authority.\n\n\nWhen there’s no link or video for the user to interact with, and you still want to visually differentiate your content from its surroundings, consider using a well or inline text instead.\n",
            'guidelines': "Content guidelines\n\nFCMs contain a headline, descriptive body copy text, an optional call-to-action link, and a graphical element related to the piece of content being featured. They are a “mini story” and never simply a dominant visual.\n\n\n  Headings should be as succinct as possible and 35 characters or less (including spaces).\n  Descriptions should be action-oriented and let the user know what they will get out of the featured content and how it’s related to the main page content, not just what it is. Descriptions should be 160 characters or less (including spaces).\n  Links serve as a call-to-action, so they should begin with an action verb like “explore,” “read,” “learn,” or “discover.” When using an action verb, be specific and tie the action back to the content and what the user will get from it. As a best practice, only include up to one link in a FCM. Link text should be 35 characters or less (including spaces).\n  Do not include a link with a video FCM. In a FCM that features video, the desired action is for the user to play the video, so the play button serves as a visual call-to-action. This makes it especially important for the description in the FCM to be action-oriented. Encourage users to take the action of watching the video, and relate directly back to the video content and what they’ll get out of it.\n\n\nStylistic guidelines\n\nText is full-width and displayed above the visual in the default/mobile view. When creating a static image for the visual, it should be 1076px × 606px (a 16:9 aspect ratio), which is 2x the rendered width at the maximum size at which the visual will be seen (on a 600px wide display).\n",

As available width dips below the maximum page width, the text area shrinks in width while the visual maintains a fixed width of 270px. That means that the height and aspect ratio of the visual will change as the screen shrinks, and the image will be cropped between 16% and 29% from each side.\n\nAt larger screen sizes, the image moves to the right of the text, occupying a fixed width of 270px (equal to 3 of 12 columns at max page width). By default, the left edge of the image is anchored to the left side of the visual’s 270px-wide area, and the right side is cropped off. The aspect ratio of the visual area increases as screen size increases, resulting in slightly different image cropping at different screen sizes, but the left edge of the image remains anchored in view. The full height of the image is always in view; the top and bottom are never cropped. See above for modifiers that change the image’s horizontal anchoring.\n",

            'description': "These are the strategic underpinnings for the CFPB’s design and development standards. They should serve as the backbone for the user experience, ensuring that the standards we set enable products that are easy to use and understand for consumers.\n\n\n\n  Public service, public trust\n\n  We aim to win the public’s trust through honest, transparent design. Using clear, concise, and approachable design, we focus on consumers. We demonstrate transparency through our user-friendly online experiences and tools and our dedication to open-source content.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Giving the user control\n\n  We design to empower users with information. The CFPB motivates consumers to take the control of their financial decision-making, and our designs enable this process. Good design increases transparency and succinctly hands the user all the necessary information, giving consumers control of how they use it. Designers must rely on introspection and research to discover what path users instinctively take and then cater to those instincts.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Aesthetic integrity\n\n  Aesthetic integrity is not merely “attractiveness”; it implies the successful integration of design and function. We align appearance with purpose by using clear and intuitive designs to create a trustworthy tone and powerful platform for supporting the CFPB’s mission. We maintain consistency and clarity to empower users to seamlessly transfer their knowledge and skills from one product to another. Focusing on consistency helps uphold aesthetic integrity.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Designing with data\n\n  Design gives voice to data, and data informs design. Because the CFPB is a data-driven organization, quantitative measures of success should be integral to the design process. Design should incorporate data to aid understanding of complex issues, and data-driven feedback should influence the design process. Succinct and compelling visualization of information gives data a voice and helps us clarify otherwise indigestible numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Inclusion and accessibility\n\n  We design for the widest possible demographic with bias toward clear articulation, plain language, and intuitive design. We design to meet each consumer where he or she is. We are sensitive to experiential level, timing, and biases and aim to design experiences that are equally accessible to everyone, and equally empowering no matter what the user’s skill set or familiarity. Simple, clean designs are the most effective and wide-reaching.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Coherent end-to-end user experience\n\n  We aim to unify parts of the user experience and transition seamlessly between them. The best design guides the user’s experience from beginning-to-end and caters to his or her expectations. Navigation between sections should be intuitive and transitions should be seamless. Consistent quality and attention to detail are essential to maintain a cohesive user experience.\n\n\n",

It’s less about what we can do for them or what we can offer them, and more about what the user can do with the resources we provide.\n  Don’t include links or calls to action within the hero. The goal of the hero is to get the user to continue reading the page, and calls to action  detract from that. If there’s content that needs to link elsewhere for explanation, place it underneath the hero, within the main content area.\n\n\nHeadings\n\nCommunicate what the user can learn from the page or the benefit the page provides. Actionable, descriptive, orienting statements work best.\n\nHeadings should be a single phrase, preferably one line at the largest breakpoint. Take care to avoid orphaned text.\n\nHeadings should not include a period at the end. Question marks can be used when a question is asked, but avoid phrasing heroes as questions.\n\n\n  One-line (at largest breakpoint): 41 characters maximum\n  Two-line (at largest breakpoint): 82 characters maximum\n\n\nSubheading content\n\nCopy underneath the heading should be brief, enticing, and build upon the heading to describe the value of the page.

Square, vertically and horizontally rectangular, diagonal, and most complex icons can fit within the relative padding bounding box. Circular and some complex icons should be slightly larger to offset the visual weight of surrounding negative space.\n\n\n\nContent guidelines\n\n\n  Icons are typically used in conjunction with text.\n  They typically match the color of the corresponding text.\n  The size of the icon should match the size of the text it corresponds to.\n\n\nInteraction details\n\nPlease reference the Links page for guidance regarding icons paired with links.\n",
            'behavior': "SVG icon basics\n\nThe cf-icon component provides Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) icons. This component can be used by itself, but is designed to work with the Design System.\n\nWe subscribe to the guidance offered by Chris Coyier in his article, “A Pretty Good SVG Icon System”, in which he concludes, “Just include the icons inline.”\n\nBecause including raw SVG code is not necessarily pretty or user-friendly, we encourage using your templating system to include them by reference.\n\n\n  Note: Jinja2, the templating language that cfgov-refresh uses, has a near-identical syntax for includes, but it requires that the path be enclosed in quotation marks, like so: {% include 'icons/download.svg' %}.\n\n\nThe filenames of the SVGs included with cf-icons match the names in the Icon library section. There are duplicate SVG files for each alias, as well.\n\n\n  Note to contributors: If any icon is ever updated, you must be sure to also update each of the alias SVGs.\n\n\nWhat the Less is doing\n\nIf you look in cf-icons.less, below the aforementioned sizing variable, you’ll see this simple rule:\n\n.cf-icon-svg {\n    height: @cf-icon-height;\n    vertical-align: text-top;\n    fill: currentColor;\n    …\n}\n\n\nReferring back to the example above, you can see that we have encoded class=\"cf-icon-svg\" in the root element of each of our SVG icons. As a result, the Less rule gets applied to all of the SVGs on the page, just like any other HTML element.\n\nWe start by limiting the size of the SVG to a proportion of the text height, using the @cf-icon-height variable’s em value. To align the canvas of the icon with the canvas of neighboring text, we set vertical-align: text-top;. Finally, setting fill: currentColor; tells the SVG to set its path’s fill color to match the color value of its parent element.\n\nCaveats\n\nThere are two modifications based on restrictions in Internet Explorer 8 and 9 (IE8/IE9).\n\nFirst, IE8 does not support fill: currentColor. Typically the fallback would be to use a PNG image, but due to the inability to know what the background or text color of its surroundings are, we found it better to fall back to the paired text with no icon.\n\nSecond, IE9 displays SVGs as full width by default (not the paths, just the SVG container). To eliminate this issue we’ve set the width of the SVGs to match the height. The whitespace to the left or right may not be quite accurate, but we determined this is an acceptable difference for a legacy browser like IE9.\n\nInline SVG background\n\nIn some cases we embed an SVG as a background image. To accomplish this, a custom less plugin is used to inject the SVG icon source file inline into the CSS background-image property. This is exposed via a mixin, .u-svg-inline-bg( @name ), where @name is the SVG icon canonical name.\n",

Illustrations should also make use of 100% white and black. Visit the color page for color values.\n\nComposition\n\nAll illustrations should have relative sizing when more than one object is included. Illustrations should appear natural, but stylized. Do not scale-up or collage minicons or isocons for use in illustrations. Minicons can be used as graphic details when scaled appropriately.\n\nIllustrations should be compositionally balanced with related headers and text. Reduce “floating” by bleeding illustrations off the edges of the graphic. Make use of layering and subtle, vector-based background patterns to help ground the illustration. Shadows are appropriate when objects overlap but should not extend outside of objects.\n\nDo not use negative space to define outlines.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nForm\n\nAll illustrations should be based on commonly used geometric shapes like circles, triangles, beams, and rectangles.\n\nTo stylize illustrations according to CFPB standards, use relative sizing on stroke weights with a rounded end cap. For curved lines, the stylized stroke is recommended throughout illustrations.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nShading and highlights\n\nObjects should be lit from the upper-left side. This is consistent with the beam in our logo. The overall placement of highlights and shading should be carefully decided by the designer and consistent throughout the project.\n\nShading should be achieved using subtle, solid tints, not gradients, textures, multiply, or blurs.\n\nThere are two types of highlights available for illustrations; curved and diagonal. The curved highlight is recommended when the object is round. Diagonal highlights are mostly used in rectangular objects. They are also frequently used to show reflections. To create a diagonal highlight, a tint of the background color is cast from the top-right corner of an object at a 45º angle.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nShadows\n\nShadows are created using a darker tint of the background color. They are appropriate when objects overlap but should not extend outside of objects. In top-facing illustrations, shadows around objects can be used to create realism.\n\nThe overall placement of shadows should be carefully decided by the designer and consistent throughout the project.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n",

A beam pattern provides grounding and an engaging graphic reference to the beam concept in our logo.\n\n  Beam patterns are composed of overlapping beams that frame areas of white space used for titles, text, and other graphic elements. Beams always point horizontally, not vertically.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  Solid green beam bleeds off the top of the layout. Beams alternate direction to create layered beam shapes.\n\n  \n\n  Layered beams anchor to the bottom, leaving plenty of white space above for type. This works especially well for horizontal layouts.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Base shapes\n\n  Beam patterns are created using trapezoids and parallelograms each at a 9° angle.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Color\n\n  Beam patterns include all three CFPB Green tones. Using transparency increases the strength of the beam metaphor. Transparency should be achieved through opacity, not blending modes like multiply / darken / etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Misuse\n\n  {% include icons/error-round.svg %} Don’t remove the light beam.

If letters are entered in a date field, if an email address is missing the “@” sign, let the user know right away by showing a field-level error on blur.\n\nThat said, it’s a good idea to always validate on the server side even if you use client-side validation for formatting checks. That’s because JavaScript validation may not work on all clients; JavaScript errors could occur no matter the client; and JS validation can easily be bypassed, which raises security concerns.\n\nIn general, the best practice for server-side validation is to mark errors with both form-level and field-level errors.\n",

In terms of placement, if the units are the same across columns, indicate the unit of measurement in the title or someplace noticeable above the table.\n\nAlternatively, if the table uses at most two units of measurement, consider using asterisks following the column label, and define the unit of measurement below the table.\n\nIf units differ from column to column, the standard is to list the unit of measure in parentheses following the column label.

When possible, be even more explicit with the width by dividing it into known character counts. For instance, social security number should be three characters, then two, then four. Be mindful of not getting too restrictive, however. This approach could work for phone numbers, but only if international numbers are not permitted.\n\nThese types of inputs should always be smaller widths:\n\n\n  Middle initial\n  Date, month, or year\n  State abbreviation\n\n\nContent guidelines\n\nText should be in sentence case.\n\nUse placeholder text for formatting examples only.

When setting body copy, the leading should be 1.375 times the type size, or 37.5% larger.\n\n\n\nLine length\n\nComfortable line length allows the user’s eyes to flow easily from the end of one line to the beginning of the next.\n\nFor a single column of text, line length should be an average of 66 characters per line, including spaces, but may range from 50 to 75 characters.\n\n\n\nSpacing\n\nWhite space affects how the user focuses their attention on the content.

Video is a complex medium, so it is essential to pay attention to every detail, for example: composition, color treatment, typography and timing. The audience should recognize a CFPB video through its unique visual treatment.\n\nView a selection of our videos at https://www.youtube.com/user/cfpbvideo.\n",

The logo must be placed on a white background.\n\n\n\nTypography\n\nTypography should be balanced with other visual content, such as live footage or illustration. Type should not overlap other content. Key messages can also be highlighted on their own using display text.\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle slides\n\nTitle slides for educational videos should feature clean typography with ample white space. A beam pattern may be used either as the background or anchored to the bottom of the composition.\n\n\n\n\n",

In most cases, the timing of text and descriptions in these files is important and should therefore be incorporated in an accessible manner.\n\nPrerecorded content\n\n\n  For audio-only content, provide a transcript of both spoken words and descriptions of other sounds.\n  For video-only content, provide an audio track or transcript that describes the video.\n  Combined audio and video content should accommodate alternatives for both (e.g., closed captioning or sign interpretation for audio, and an audio track or a screenplay-like document that transcribes dialog and descriptions of sounds and action for video).\n\n\nLive content\n\n\n  Closed captioning or sign language interpretation should always be available, but in some cases providing the prepared remarks or script alongside the audio/video may suffice.\n\n\nMake content easily distinguishable from its surroundings\n\nThese guidelines help ensure that content is perceivable for sighted users.\n\nAudio\n\n\n  Avoid auto-playing audio. If this is absolutely unavoidable, provide a control that allows the user to stop the audio and adjust or mute the volume.\n  In recorded audio, background sounds should be at least 20 dB lower than foreground sounds and speech. This does not apply to music.\n\n\nDo not create designs or interactions that may cause seizures\n\n\n  Nothing on the page should flash more than 3 times in 1 second.\n\n",
