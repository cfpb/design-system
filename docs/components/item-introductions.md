          ##### WHEN TO USE

          * When introducing a specific article or post (such as a press release or blog post) or document or group of documents (such as a report, rule or enforcement action) linked through a filterable list.

          *  When the page contains specific content about one subject; there arenâ€™t any child pages that drill down to anything more specific.


          ##### WHEN OTHER OPTIONS ARE BETTER

          * When creating general content pages, even if the content is detailed or lengthy.
