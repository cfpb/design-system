description: Alerts draw a user's attention to a change in the status of a form
  or page. Form-level alerts reflect a user or system action and appear below
  the form title. Field-level alerts appear inline with input fields and can
  highlight successful submissions, errors that need to be corrected, or details
  to know before submitting a form.
use_cases: ""
behavior: >-
  ### Placement


  * Form-level alerts should appear below the form title.

  * Field-level alerts (icon and validation status message) should always appear below the input field.


  ### Validation


  Where possible, display formatting errors immediately using client-side validation so the user doesn’t have to wait until submitting to see what went wrong (this is especially frustrating if the information the user enters the first time around is not cached on submit and they have to fill out all the fields again from scratch). If letters are entered in a date field, if an email address is missing the “@” sign, let the user know right away by showing a field-level error on blur.


  That said, it’s a good idea to always validate on the server side even if you use client-side validation for formatting checks. That’s because JavaScript validation may not work on all clients; JavaScript errors could occur no matter the client; and JS validation can easily be bypassed, which raises security concerns.


  In general, the best practice for server-side validation is to mark errors with both form-level and field-level errors.
accessibility: >-
  * For screen reader accessibility, form-level errors should include anchor
  links to the problem field in question.

  * Place form-level alerts below the form title.

  * In general, use distinct icons, contrasting colors, prominent placement, and text to indicate errors. Don’t rely on just one method, as users can have many different accessibility needs (color blind users, visually impaired users, users with motor control issues, etc.).
