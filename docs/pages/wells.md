  Wells should generally be text-based. If content must include imagery or
  videos, use the [featured content
  module](/design-system/patterns/featured-content-module) instead.


  Examples of types of content to include:


  * Headings (H2 - H5), which should be 35 characters including spaces or less

  * Succinct text including bullets and numbered lists

  * Links
eyebrow: Featured content
title: Wells
description: Wells are used to highlight specific information within a
  designated section of a page. This breaks up the flow of content on the page
  and helps to emphasize and set apart the content that is included. They are
  generally used on
  [browse](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/pages/browse-pages),
  [learn](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/pages/learn-pages), and [document
  detail
  pages](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/pages/document-detail-pages).
use_cases: Wells should be used to feature content or specific call to actions.
  They should be used sparingly and ideally not take up more than a third of
  page content.
behavior: Wells are full width. At breakpoints 600px and under there are slight
  padding adjustments to maximize real estate on smaller displays.
