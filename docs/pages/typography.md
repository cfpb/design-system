guidelines: >-
  Readable text allows users to efficiently read and take in textual
  information. Text that is not readable turns off readers or makes it
  challenging for them to stay focused. The following guidelines promote good
  readability.


  ### Alignment


  Typography should be set flush left. This provides the eye a constant starting point for each line, making text easier to read.


  ![Alignment](/design-system/images/uploads/type_alignment.png)


  ### Line height


  Ample space between lines of type promotes an open feeling and lends flow to body copy. When setting body copy, the leading should be 1.375 times the type size, or 37.5% larger.


  ![Line height](/design-system/images/uploads/type_line_height.png)


  ### Line length


  Comfortable line length allows the reader’s eyes to flow easily from the end of one line to the beginning of the next. The ideal line length is 66 characters, including spaces, though lengths may range from 45 to 90 characters.


  In digital materials, readers are afforded some level of control over line length by narrowing their browser window or changing the type size display on their devices. In printed materials, readers do not have this control. For this reason, special effort should be made to use a line length as close as possible to 66 characters in printed materials. This can be achieved by using a multi-column layout or larger margins.

  ### Spacing


  White space affects how the user focuses their attention on the content. It makes it easier to know what to read and where to begin. Spacing between typographic elements should be open enough to feel light, but close enough to establish a proper relationship between elements.


  #### Heading followed by body copy


  When a heading is followed by paragraph text, include 30px of space below Display and 15px below Headings 1–6.

  #### Body copy followed by a heading


  When body copy is followed by a heading, include 45px of space above Heading 2 and 30px above Headings 3–6.

  #### Heading followed by a heading


  For stacked headings, include 30 px of space after the primary heading.

  #### Body copy spacing


  For multiple paragraphs within the same section set the space between paragraphs to 15px.

  communication of our brand. Type should be light and well-spaced to reinforce
  that we are transparent, open, and approachable. This system uses weight,
  scale, and capitalization to convey the relative importance of each heading
  within a document. Readability, accessibility, and font smoothing to allow all

  Web Content Accessibility (WCAG) standards ensure that content is accessible by everyone, regardless of any disability or user device. To learn more, refer to the [http://www.section508.gov](https://www.section508.gov/).


  ### Don't use type in illustrations or graphics


  Type should generally not be used within an illustration or other graphic, as assistive technology such as screen readers can't make sense of the words.


  ### Colored type is restricted


  Never use colored type, unless it’s a link.  This restriction includes all brand colors, including CFPB green.


  Although accessible, the combinations of black type on green or green type on black should never be used.


  ### Accessible and brand compliant combinations


  To ensure text remains compliant with [WCAG 2.0 standards](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/), use only these permitted type and background color combinations, which fall within the range of foreground/background color contrast permitted by the Section 508 guidelines. For specific color values, visit our [Color page](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/foundation/color).


  #### Black type on colored backgrounds


  Black type is accessible on all brand colors with 20% saturation or below when using at least 14pt type. Hex values for those colors are shown in parentheses in the image below; for their RGB equivalents, [visit our Color page](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/foundation/color#tints).


  A few colors allow for slightly darker saturations while still maintaining accessibility. If you're looking to use a combination not listed here, check [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)  to verify accessibility.

  #### White type on colored backgrounds


  White type is accessible on CFPB brand colors at 100% saturation and their darker shades when using at least 14pt type, with the following two exceptions:


  * White type is accessible on CFPB green at 100% saturation and its darker shades *only* when using at least 14pt bold type. Alternatively, use at least 18pt regular type.

  * White type is not accessible on any CFPB shade of gold.


  The graphic below shows accessible combinations of white type on CFPB brand colors at 100% saturation. Hex values for those colors are shown in parentheses; for their RGB equivalents, [visit our Color page](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/foundation/color#tints).
