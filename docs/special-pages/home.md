  ## Welcome to the CFPB Design System 


  The Design System is an open-source resource for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) teams to produce effective and visually-consistent products that are easy for the American public to access, use, and understand. 


  Start by reading our [general principles](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/foundation/general-principles) and [accessibility principles](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/foundation/accessibility). Then go to one of the sections below to get started. 


  ### Foundation

  This section includes our visual identity standards, such as color, grid, and typography. It forms the foundation for the CFPB’s website and external-facing materials. 


  [Browse foundation](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/foundation/)


  ### Components

  Components contain the key building blocks of the design system that, when combined, can be used to create a website. Examples of components include buttons, text inputs, tables, and alerts. 


  [Browse components](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/components/)


  ### Patterns

  Patterns include interaction patterns, which combine components into best practice design solutions in order to allow users to achieve a goal; and layout patterns, for designers to use to organize content into clear, accessible web pages.

  Learn how to integrate our design system into your project, contribute to the code base, and update the documentation. [Get started](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/getting-started/)


  ### Development

  The development section includes utilities, such as variables, helper classes, and mixins, and layout options, such as blocks.

  ## About the CFPB Design System


  Our design system has been created to work with a wide range of devices and browsers. Following a modern, mobile first responsive approach, sites built with our Design System easily adapt to a wide range of screen sizes, all while carefully following accessibility best practices.

  As a work of the United States government, all code is open source and in the public domain. We encourage you to use this framework in your own projects and to contribute back.
