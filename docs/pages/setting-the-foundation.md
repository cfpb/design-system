  biases](#identify-lived-experiences-and-biases)


  Investigate internalized oppression


  Use bias-free, person-centered language


  Establish team values


  Assemble diverse teams


  ### Identify lived experiences and biases


  Bias is the tendency to allow personal opinions and past experiences to
  influence one’s judgment. Many of these biases may be unconscious, but they
  are none the less damaging to others. They are often based on false
  stereotypes about a particular group. It’s part of the human condition to rely
  on these cognitive shortcuts and to assume others think like us or have
  similar values, opinions, and beliefs.\ 


  Bias can skew our research and design activities, whether in our choice of
  who participates, what information is collected, or how information is
  interpreted. Awareness of our biases is key to mitigating against them, and
  that’s where the frames of reference exercise can be particularly valuable.

  <h2>Frames of reference</h2>


  *Adapted from 18F’s [presentation on equity-centered design and
  research](https://digital.gov/files/equity-centered-design-revised.pptx)*


  As a team, run through this activity to identify your individual and
  collective biases before beginning research or design activities. If possible,
  couple the exercise with a review of what you have learned about the audience.
  \ 


  Everyone should choose how they want to participate, but ideally this can be
  a group activity.


  <b>1. Ahead of the activity, add the following prompts to an online
  collaboration tool set to private mode (or a setting that allows for anonymous
  contribution).</b> Organize the prompts so all participants have enough room
  to add their responses. (More prompts can be found in 18F’s [frames of
  reference
  form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScI0iTQEstjECMzFVuyMt0Giku69Yg\
  gEkAlybQPlH4y7Ik9Vg/viewform).)\ 


  <div class=\"content-50 content-first\" markdown=\"1\">


  * Types of locations where you’ve lived (e.g. urban, rural)

  * Typical internet speed (high speed, cellular only)

  * Typical equipment used to access the internet (desktop or laptop computer,
  or mobile device only)\ 

  * Race & ethnicity\ 

  * Gender & sexual identity\ 

  * Age\ 

  * Food insecurity\ 

  * Housing insecurity\ 


  </div>


  <div class=\"content-50 content-last\" markdown=\"1\">


  * Immigration status, or whether you’ve ever lived with an immigrant\ 

  * Languages spoken \ 

  * Familiarity with physical & mental disabilities \ 

  * Use of assistive technologies\ 

  * Marital and parental status\ 

  * Where you grew up\ 

  * Your values\ 

  * Your organization’s values  \ 


  </div>


  <b>2. During the collaboration session, ask the team to spend a few minutes
  privately noting their own personal, lived experiences in response to each of
  these prompts.</b>


  <b>3﻿. If the team wants to share their findings: </b>


  * Ask participants to add their findings anonymously to the collaboration
  tool. Emphasize that participants should choose how they wish to participate
  in this activity.

  * As a team, gather and organize the anonymized responses. Group them and
  identify themes. Ask participants what they noticed as they were doing this
  exercise. Was anything missing? Was anything surprising? For example, if
  everyone on the team lives in an urban environment, this exercise can help
  prompt awareness and discussion of the needs of people living in more rural
  areas.\ 


  <b>I﻿f the team wants to keep their findings private:</b>


  * … and this is a new team: Discuss the prompts at a higher level, perhaps
  focusing on the agency mission and possible gaps in the team’s lived
  experience. For example, the team could spend more time drawing attention to
  gaps in internet speed and equipment, food and housing insecurity, and/or the
  needs of people with disabilities.\ 

  * … and the team is doing this exercise when beginning a project: Use a
  project-focused lens to run this exercise and discuss the prompts at a higher
  level.\ 


  \  * What biases could come into play in this particular project?

  \  * Do any of us have any lived experience that would help us in planning
  this project?

  wheel](https://design.ncsu.edu/blog/2022/01/07/from-a-to-z-lesley-ann-noel-an\
  d-decolonizing-design/) is another form of the Frames of Reference exercise.\ 

  * The Decision Lab has a [list of the most relevant cognitive biases in
  behavioral economics](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases), which can be applied
  to our own biases as designers and researchers, but also participants.\ 

  * Nielsen Norman Group has several resources pertaining to bias in UX. Watch
  their video, [Decision Biases Affecting UX Practitioners](]
  \"https\\://www.nngroup.com/videos/decision-biases-ux-practitioners/\"), to
  learn how to mitigate your own biases. \ 


  ### Investigate internalized oppression


  We encourage everyone to read widely to examine their own identity and
  internalized oppression—the false narratives or stereotypes that they may have
  internalized about themselves, and how they might perpetuate systemic
  oppression.\ 


  <div class =\"eyebrow\">{% include icons/book.svg %} F﻿urther reading</div>


  For more information, Intentional Futures has a useful explanation of
  systemic oppression and how it manifests in their [Introduction to
  Equity-Centered
  Design](https://www.intentionalfutures.com/public/ecd-booklet.pdf).
  Additionally, consider using the [implicit bias test put together by
  Harvard](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/user/agg/blindspot/indexrk.htm\
  ), which is designed to identify unconscious positive and negative
  associations based on race.\ 


  ### Use bias-free, person-centered language


  It’s important to use clear, respectful, inclusive language that’s free of
  stereotypes and generalizations. Our words matter, whether we’re addressing
  the general public or a fellow team member. Follow the guidelines below:\ 


  <b>Ensure the terms and references you use to refer to a group are both
  respectful and accurate.</b><br>

  Some terms may not be accurate to describe a group, while other terms can
  have negative connotations. For example, as [18F points out, the term
  “American Indians and Alaskan Natives” is not an all-encompassing term for
  Indigenous
  Americans](https://github.com/18F/Equity-centered-design-with-American-Indian\
  s-and-Alaska-Natives-10x/wiki/Intro-Why-Equity-Centered-Design#words-that-car\
  ry-weight), as it does not include members of non-federally-recognized tribes,
  or Indigenous Americans who are not members of a tribe.\ 


  Use the terminology that groups and individuals use for themselves. This
  includes the gender pronouns of any individuals you work with directly. Do
  your research, read the resources listed in the “Further Reading” section
  below, and ask members of the group in question directly if you’re in doubt.
  \ 


  <b>Use people-first language.</b><br>

  [People-first
  language](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-languag\
  e/disability) is a way to respectfully acknowledge the humanity of an
  individual or group first, rather than the identity or condition they may
  experience. Examples of people-first language include “people with a mental
  disorder”, rather than calling someone “mentally ill”, or referring to someone
  as a “person without housing”, rather than as a “homeless person”. The
  specific terms preferred by an individual or group can vary, and do not always
  include people-first syntax; additionally, language is always changing. Refer
  to the resources in the “Further Reading” section below to better understand
  how to use people-first language, and always ask people directly how they wish
  to define themselves. \ 


  <b>Consider avoiding the word “user” when referring to the people we
  serve.</b><br>\ 

  In line with using people-first language, consider using the word “people”
  instead of “user” when referring to those we’re trying to help. “User” can
  depersonalize our intended audience, potentially reducing them to a
  one-dimensional data point. “People”, in contrast, acknowledges the many
  distinct individuals who are interacting with the services we create for them,
  and helps us think collectively about the multiplicity of their viewpoints and
  lived experiences. \

  <div class =\"eyebrow\">{% include icons/edit.svg %} Activity</div>


  <h2>﻿Set intentional language</h2>


  Take time during your team formation and when beginning a new project to
  review the guidelines and references above. [APA’s Bias Free Language
  Guide](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language)
  and [Language, Please](https://languageplease.org/) are both excellent guides
  to inclusive language, and contain robust lists of appropriate person- and
  identity- first terms. Discuss this guidance as a team and come to a shared
  understanding of language to use.  \ 


  </div>




  <h2>Establish team values</h2>\r

  \r

  Discussing and documenting your team values will enable your group to create
  a shared understanding of how you want to work together and why you’re making
  those choices. Revisit your team values throughout your work to stay grounded
  in your intentions.  \r

  \r

   ACTIVITY\r

  \r

  Create a set of equity-centered team values\r

  \r

  For newly established teams, create team values that incorporate the results
  of both the frames of reference and intentional language exercises above. An
  example of team values could include, embracing discomfort, vulnerability, the
  awareness that we do not know everything, and understanding that just because
  we have not experienced something does not make it untrue.\r

  \r

  Once you’ve created your team values, find opportunities to regularly review
  your values as a team. For example, read these values during your sprint
  planning ceremonies.\r
