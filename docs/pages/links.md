  contrast, [buttons](/design-system/components/buttons) are used to signal

          Call-to-action links are standalone links underneath paragraphs that
          highlight users' next steps. They are medium weight and often used in
          unordered lists.

        variation_implementation: Call-to-action links are used in
          [cards](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/patterns/cards) and [info
          unit
          groups](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/patterns/info-unit-groups),
          among other places.

        variation_description: Destructive links provide a visual warning to users that
          clicking them will perform a destructive action, such as clearing
          entries in a form.
    variation_group_description: >+
      Links that appear in body text (`p`), link lists (`li`), or definitions
      (`dd`) are automatically underlined. To enable underlines elsewhere, e.g.
      to underline links in a `nav` element, simply add a `border-bottom-width:
      1px;` to the link.

  - variation_group_name: Links with icons
    variation_group_description: >-
      * An icon should appear after the text it represents.  

      * Each icon should be used exclusively and consistently for one action.

      * The color and font-size of an icon should be the same as the text it represents, including state changes. 

      * Icons should never be underlined.

          </p>
        variation_name: Standard link with icon
        variation_description: To prevent the link’s underline from extending under the
          icon, wrap the link text with a `span.icon-link_text`. There can be no
          whitespace between the text and the opening and closing span tags.
          Include the icon either prior to or after the `a-link_text`. It is
          important the text and icon are siblings to correctly handle
          underlines.
      - variation_name: Non-wrapping icon links
        variation_description: Icons added to inline links can sometimes break onto the
          next line. If you want to prevent this, you can add the `__no-wrap`
          modifier to `.a-link__icon`.

behavior: >-
  ### Default links

  In general, links should default to opening in the same page or browser tab. This allows the user to choose whether they want to open an additional window in order to view the content. This applies to document and external links.


  ### Opening a link in a new tab

  Links should open in a new tab in situations where users enter data or make selections that would be lost if they left the page. This includes interactive tools, search filters, and forms where the user has to enter and submit information.


  Add `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"` to direct these links to securely open in a new tab.


  Add an `aria-label` that includes the link text and informs users with visual impairments that the link will open in a new tab. An example would be `aria-label="Learn why some county data are unavailable. (Link opens in new tab.)"` This meets [WCAG guideline 3.2 that webpages should work in a predictable way](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G201.html).
accessibility: >-
  Link text should clearly describe where it will take the user if activated. If
  a screen reader user is cycling through the links on a page, link text such as
  "Read more" or "Click here" is not helpful for knowing where that link will
  take them. Write the link with language clearly describing the link's
  destination.


  In situations where that's untenable, you can improve the situation for screen reader users by coding the link with the `aria-label` attribute and adding more descriptive link text, which will be read aloud by screen readers.
