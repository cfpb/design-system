        variation_name: Archived content banner
        variation_description: The archived content banner is used to identify website
          pages that are outdated and should no longer be referenced for
          guidance. These pages may have historical value or significance to
          researchers, historians, and the public.

eyebrow: Alerts
title: Banner (notification)
description: Banner notifications communicate high-priority information about
  the state or status of page content.  Banner notifications are positioned at
  the top of the page and span the full width. When used on a webpage, banner
  notifications inform users of important information that is not specific to an
  immediate task.
use_cases: Use the banner notification to communicate important information
  about the state or status of page content or to highlight high-priority system
  or product level information that is not related to a specific task. Use the
  inline notification instead when calling out specific page content or when
  alerting users as to information that is relevant to the immediate task.
