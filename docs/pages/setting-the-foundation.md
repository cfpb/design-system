  ## Working together


  Identify lived experiences and biases


  Investigate internalized oppression


  Use bias-free, person-centered language


  Establish team values


  Assemble diverse teams


  ### Identify lived experiences and biases


  Bias is the tendency to allow personal opinions and past experiences to influence one’s judgment. Many of these biases may be unconscious, but they are none the less damaging to others. They are often based on false stereotypes about a particular group. It’s part of the human condition to rely on these cognitive shortcuts and to assume others think like us or have similar values, opinions, and beliefs. 


  Bias can skew our research and design activities, whether in our choice of who participates, what information is collected, or how information is interpreted. Awareness of our biases is key to mitigating against them, and that’s where the frames of reference exercise can be particularly valuable.

  <h2>Frames of reference</h2>


  *Adapted from 18F’s [presentation on equity-centered design and research](https://digital.gov/files/equity-centered-design-revised.pptx)*


  As a team, run through this activity to identify your individual and collective biases before beginning research or design activities. If possible, couple the exercise with a review of what you have learned about the audience.  


  Everyone should choose how they want to participate, but ideally this can be a group activity.


  <b>1. Ahead of the activity, add the following prompts to an online collaboration tool set to private mode (or a setting that allows for anonymous contribution).</b> Organize the prompts so all participants have enough room to add their responses. (More prompts can be found in 18F’s frames of reference form.)
