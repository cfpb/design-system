description: >-
  Featured content modules (FCMs) highlight a specific piece of content at the
  top of a page. It’s meant to call attention to a related piece of content that
  might be new or otherwise relevant to—but not directly a part of—the main
  content on the page, the primary intended user action, or the user journey.



  The goal of the FCM is to have the user do one of three things: learn
  something (usually by navigating to other content), watch something, or
  download something (a printable tool or resource). Because this content is
  being featured temporarily, and not meant to be permanent, it shouldn’t be
  seen as integral to the page, meaning the content could be changed or removed
  from the page without taking away vital information the user needs or
  interrupting the user journey. Therefore, this module is not intended to
  support the site IA as the primary, permanent location for content.



  FCMs appear below the title and introductory paragraph on a page, and retain
  that position on all screen sizes. FCMs can appear on any page type, though
  they are best suited for pages third level and below in the site map. They are
  designed to accommodate pages with either a left-hand navigation or right-hand
  sidebar.

          To anchor a featured content module’s visual on the right (for example,
          when displaying a map with a copyright watermark on the right), add the
          `o-featured-content-module__right` modifier class to the
          `o-featured-content-module` organism. This anchors the right side of the
          image to the right of the available space so that the right side remains
          in view at all screen sizes.

          When the featured content module visual is a video, or a static image
          composed with its subject in the middle, add the
          `o-featured-content-module__center` modifier class to the
          `o-featured-content-module` organism. This anchors the center of the image
          to the center of the available space so that the focal point of the visual
          remains in view at all screen sizes.

  #### Use cases


  Use a featured content module (FCM) when you want to highlight something
  that’s:


  * **Timely**: Highlights a new tool or development. Keep in mind: When you
  remove dated content from a FCM, make sure you're not getting rid of the only
  way users can navigate to it. Make sure to plan a permanent home for the
  content.


  * **Impactful**: Lets people know immediately how the content will affect
  them, how they can use it, and how it might enhance their understanding of—or
  experience with—the primary page content.


  * **Localized**: New content that specifically applies to people in a specific
  geographic area; it may be important for that audience to see their specific
  content first, and when it’s removed from the page it won’t disrupt the usual
  user flow.


  * **Unique**: Content that is specifically in the Bureau’s “wheelhouse”
  because of our position as an approachable, trusted, unbiased authority.


  Featured content modules should highlight a single piece of content. That
  content can be almost anything, from a webpage to a blog post to a PDF to a
  video.


  FCMs appear below the title and introductory paragraph on a page, and retain
  that position on all screen sizes.


  FCMs contain a headline, body copy text, a call to action (either a text link
  or a play button), and a graphical element related to the piece of content
  being featured. They are a “mini story” and never simply a dominant visual.


  FCMs can appear on any page type, though they are best suited for pages third
  level and below in the site map. They are designed to accommodate pages with
  either a left-hand navigation or right-hand sidebar.


  ##### When other options are better


  * When the content is an integral, long-term part of the intended user
  journey, then it should have a more permanent home on the page.


  * When there’s no link or video for the user to interact with. If you just
  want to visually differentiate your content from its surroundings, consider
  using a well or inline text instead.


  #### Content guidelines


  FCMs contain a headline, descriptive body copy text, an optional
  call-to-action link, and a graphical element related to the piece of content
  being featured. They are a “mini story” and never simply a dominant visual.


  * Headings should be as succinct as possible and 35 characters or less
  (including spaces).


  * Descriptions should be action-oriented and let the user know what they will
  get out of the featured content and how it's related to the main page content,
  not just what it is. Descriptions should be 160 characters or less (including
  spaces).


  * Links serve as a call-to-action, so they should begin with an action verb
  like “explore,” “read,” “learn,” or “discover.” When using an action verb, be
  specific and tie the action back to the content and what the user will get
  from it. As a best practice, only include up to one link in a FCM. Link text
  should be 35 characters or less (including spaces).


  * Do not include a link with a video FCM. In a FCM that features video, the
  desired action is for the user to play the video, so the play button serves as
  a visual call-to-action. This makes it especially important for the
  description in the FCM to be action-oriented. Encourage users to take the
  action of watching the video, and relate directly back to the video content
  and what they’ll get out of it.


  Text is full-width and displayed above the visual in the default/mobile view.
  When creating a static image for the visual, it should be 1076px × 606px (a
  16:9 aspect ratio), which is 2x the rendered width at the maximum size at
  which the visual will be seen (on a 600px wide display).


  #### Behavior


  At desktop size, the ratio of text and visual changes with screen size to keep
  the full height of the image visible. As available width dips below the
  maximum page width, the text area shrinks in width while the visual maintains
  a fixed width of 270px. That means that the height and aspect ratio of the
  visual will change as the screen shrinks, and the image will be cropped
  between 16% and 29% from each side.


  At larger screen sizes, the image moves to the right of the text, occupying a
  fixed width of 270px (equal to 3 of 12 columns at max page width). By default,
  the left edge of the image is anchored to the left side of the visual’s
  270px-wide area, and the right side is cropped off. The aspect ratio of the
  visual area increases as screen size increases, resulting in slightly
  different image cropping at different screen sizes, but the left edge of the
  image remains anchored in view. The full height of the image is always in
  view; the top and bottom are never cropped. See below for modifiers that
  change the image’s horizontal anchoring.
