          Adds dividers between specified `.content-l_col-X-X` classes.


          Layout dividers work in conjunction with `.content-l_col-X-X` elements and
          have specific needs depending on which column element variant they are
          attached to. For example, `.content-l_col-1-2` has different divider needs
          than `.content-l_col-1-3` because they may break to single columns at
          different breakpoints.


          Dividers use absolute positioning relative to the `.content-l` element and
          depend on `.content-l` using `position: relative;`. This allows vertical
          dividers to span the height of the tallest column. Just be aware that if
          you have more than one row of columns, and each row has columns of
          different widths, the borders will cause unwanted overlapping since they
          will span the height of the entire `.content-l` element.

        variation_description: >-
          `cf-grid` columns use left and right `border` for fixed `margin` which
          means itâ€™s not possible to set visual left and right borders directly on
          them. Instead we can use the `:before` pseudo element and position it
          absolutely. The added benefit of doing it this way is that the `border`
          spans the entire height of the next parent using `position: relative;`.
          This means that the `border` will always match the height of the tallest
          column in the row.


          ```

          .my-column-1-2 {

              // Creates a column that spans 6 out of 12 columns.
              .grid_column(6, 12);

              // Add a top divider only at screen 599px and smaller.
              .respond-to-max(599px {
                  .grid_column__top-divider();
              });

              // Add a left divider only at screen 600px and larger.
              .respond-to-min(600px, {
                  .grid_column__left-divider();
              });

          }
