    variation_group_name: Standard well
use_cases: >-
  Use sparingly to attract usersâ€™ attention to a concise piece of content.
  Ideally, content within a well should not take up more than a third of page
  content.

  Full width text, images, and embedded media (like video) may be placed within wells, however, if content includes imagery also consider the [Featured Content Module](/design-system/components/featured-content-module).
content_guidelines: >-
  * Grey wells should be used to feature content or specific calls to action;
  text should be succinct.


  * A grey well will help visually set apart the content within it, so use it to draw attention to that content.


  * Grey wells should take up less than a third of a page.


  * Currently, grey wells should contain single column content only.



  Types of atoms you can place in a well include:


  * Headings (H2 - H5).


  * Text (including bullets and numbered lists).


  * Links.


  * Headings should be as succinct as possible and 35 characters or less (including spaces).

  Wells are full width. At breakpoints 600 and under there are slight padding adjustments to maximize real estate on smaller displays.
