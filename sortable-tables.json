When the table loads, it should be sorted by one of the sortable columns by default and indicate which column is already sorted. Not every column of a table needs to be sortable.\n\nAt large screen sizes, tables can be sorted using the header of any sortable column.\n* The currently sorted column is marked with an up or down triangle for ascending and descending sorts, respectively\n* On hover, the currently sorted column shows the opposite triangle\n* Columns that can sort show an up triangle on hover\n* Columns that cannot sort show nothing on hover\n\nIf sorting is needed for smaller screens, use a filter-like expandable with a sorting control (or add a sorting control to the existing filter if the table has one) that only appears when the table switches from tabular to stacked.\n\nMore information can be found at:\n\n* http://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/page-components/tables.html\t\n* https://cfpb.github.io/capital-framework/components/cf-tables/#sortable-tables","objects":{"entry":{"path":"docs/components/sortable-tables.md","sha":"4c792de66d0bb17ee7b62b016e3a326f657503ec"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2019-08-13T16:36:11.411Z"}
