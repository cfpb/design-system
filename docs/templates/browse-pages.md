  Browse page types provide specific topic or product overviews and information.
  Often these pages contain medium-length content, access to specific documents
  or other resources, or descriptions of action steps.


  Related browse pages within a specific section can be accessed via the left
  side sub-navigation so users can easily move around within the topic. Browse
  pages can have parent-child relationships to other browse pages.


  This page is under active development. Information is being moved into it from
  this page:

  #### Use case


  ##### When to use

  * When adding new information to an existing topic area within one of the main
  navigation verticals.

  * When introducing a sub-topic, describing action items, or listing out
  resources.

  * Target user is primarily in a browse mindset, interested in quickly
  consuming information and keeping an eye out for key phrases, so content on
  this page should be grouped to help them quickly find relevant information.


  ##### When other options are better

  * When page content is a lengthy article or text.


  #### Content guidelines

  Content should be displayed in a way that allows for ease of browsing; group
  content in ways that makes it easy to find.


  Page titles are sentence case and use the word “and” instead of “&”. Left side
  sub-navigation and breadcrumb labels follow same style as the main menu.


  Try to avoid creating superfluous paragraphs to contain url text; list urls
  where possible and minimize unnecessary content; this will help the user
  browse and find what they need faster, and helps to give visual clarity
  without the need to read the entire paragraph to find what they need.


  Area 1: Introduction

  * Text introduction is required.

  Area 2: Main content

  * Must contain at least 1 component.

  Area 3: Prefooter

  * Optional.

  * If using both static and dynamic content, preference for dynamic content to
  appear above static content.


  #### Behavior

  Below the 901 px breakpoint, the sub-navigation collapses into the global
  navigation under a hamburger menu, as seen on the [Regulatory agenda
  page](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/policy-compliance/rulemaking/regulatory-agenda/).
  In cases where a browse page has children browse pages, the children will
  appear in a special expandable navigation at the top of the page, as seen on
  the [Implementation and guidance
  page](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/policy-compliance/guidance/implementation-guidance/).
