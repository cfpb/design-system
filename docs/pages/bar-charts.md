description: Use bar or column charts to show comparisons of different discrete
  items, factors or categories. Comparisons could include items that can be
  counted and categorized. These are some of the easiest charts to interpret
  because the data is shown by length of bar.

  * If exact numbers are important, the bars should be labeled with the value.

  * When possible label directly rather than relying on color.

  * For stacked charts, use a white line or stroke to create contrast between bar chunks.

  * For color guidance, view [Data visualization palettes](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/foundation/color#data-visualization-palettes) on the Color page.
