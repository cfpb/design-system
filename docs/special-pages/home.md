  ## Start with our principles


  Start by reading our [general principles](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/foundation/general-principles), which form the strategic underpinnings for the CFPB’s design and development standards, and [accessibility principles](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/foundation/accessibility), which lay the foundation for ensuring that our web content is available for all users.

  ### [Patterns](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/patterns/)

  Patterns are combinations of components used in conjunction to achieve a goal. Interaction patterns are best practice design solutions to common user tasks. Layout patterns are used by designers to organize content into clear, accessible web pages. [Browse patterns](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/patterns/)

  ## Contributing to the Design System

  We strongly encourage you to participate in the growth and maintenance of the Design System. To make contribution easier, the Design System is built on a tool called Netlify CMS, which allows for editing of pages in a web browser, without needing to use git or other command-line tools.
