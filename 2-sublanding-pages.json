The sub-landing page template should always be used as a child page to the [landing page](/design-system/templates/landing-pages) template.\n\nSimilar to landing pages, the focus of these pages is enabling users to quickly understand a topic area and select the specific information that meets their need. Unlike the landing page, this template allows for lengthier content components to allow for further explanation of a topic if needed.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"docs/templates/2-sublanding-pages.md","sha":"5e27caf65d87e0fc158179ab3b7c290dfdd09bad"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2019-10-24T21:32:29.211Z"}
