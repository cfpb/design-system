  Photography is an important tool that helps us relate to consumers,
  communicate empathy, and build trust. CFPB images should preserve aesthetic
  integrity: photographs should never be stretched, free of special effects, and
  always in full color. Images should be relatable, natural, and shot in a real
  location.

      Editorial photographs capture the events and activities attended by CFPB
      staff. These photographs show consumers, our partners, and CFPB employees
      interacting.

      Photographs should not be collaged, staged, unrealistic, or use still
      lifes to illustrate concepts. Image manipulation should be limited to
      adjusting levels, contrast, and natural color balance.

  #### Include text alternatives for non-text content

  For any content that is not text-based (images, audio, video, animations,
  charts, graphs, etc), provide an alternative version of that content that is
  text-based.

  * Use the `alt` and `title` attributes on images and other graphical elements.

  * Include descriptive text near images (for example, a pie chart legend with
  percentages of each item).
