  ### Identify lived experiences and biases


  Bias is the tendency to allow personal opinions and experiences to influence one’s judgment. It’s part of the human condition to rely on these cognitive shortcuts and to assume others think like us or have similar values, opinions, and beliefs. Bias can skew our research and design activities, whether in our choice of who participates, what information is collected, or how information is interpreted. Awareness of our biases is key to mitigating against them, and that’s where the frames of reference exercise can be particularly valuable.

  >

  > ### Frames of reference

  >

  > As a team, run through this activity to identify your individual and collective biases before beginning research or design activities. If possible, couple the exercise with a review of what you have learned about the audience.   

  >

  > Everyone should choose how they want to participate, but ideally this can be a group activity.   

  >

  > **1. Ahead of the activity, add the following prompts to an online collaboration tool set to private mode.** Organize the prompts so all participants have enough room to add their responses. (More prompts can be found in [18F’s frames of reference form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScI0iTQEstjECMzFVuyMt0Giku69YggEkAlybQPlH4y7Ik9Vg/viewform).)

  >

  > * Types of locations where you’ve lived (e.g. urban, rural)   

  > * Typical internet speed (high speed, cellular only)  

  > * Typical equipment used to access the internet (desktop or laptop computer, or mobile device only)   

  > * Race & ethnicity   

  > * Gender identity   

  > * Age   

  > * Food insecurity  

  > * Housing insecurity

  > <div class="content-50 content-last" markdown="1">

  > * Immigration status, or whether you’ve ever lived with an immigrant  

  > * Languages spoken   

  > * Familiarity with physical & mental disabilities   

  > * Use of assistive technologies  

  > * Marital and parental status  

  > * Where you grew up  

  > * Your values

  > * Your agency’s values    

  >   </div>

  >

  > **2. During the collaboration session, ask the team to spend a few minutes privately noting their own personal, lived experiences in response to each of these prompts.**  

  >

  > **3. If the team wants to share their findings:**   

  >

  > * Ask participants to add the findings anonymously to the collaboration tool.   

  > * As a team, gather and organize the anonymized responses. Group them and identify themes. Ask participants what they noticed as they were doing this exercise. Was anything missing? Was anything surprising? For example, if everyone on the team lives in an urban environment, this exercise can help prompt awareness and discussion of the needs of people living in more rural areas.  

  >

  > **If the team wants to keep their findings private:**   

  >

  > * … and this is a new team: Discuss the prompts at a higher level, perhaps focusing on the agency mission and possible gaps in the team’s lived experience. For example, the team could spend more time drawing attention to gaps in internet speed and equipment, food and housing insecurity, and/or the needs of people with disabilities.  

  > * … and the team is doing this exercise when beginning a project: Use a project-focused lens to run this exercise and discuss the prompts at a higher level.  

  >

  >   * What biases could come into play in this particular project? 

  >   * Do any of us have any lived experience that would help us in planning this project?

  * The [positionality wheel](https://design.ncsu.edu/blog/2022/01/07/from-a-to-z-lesley-ann-noel-and-decolonizing-design/) is another form of the Frames of Reference exercise. 

  * The Decision Lab has [a list of the most relevant cognitive biases in behavioral economics](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases), which can be applied to our own biases as designers and researchers, but also participants.  

  * Nielsen Norman Group has several resources pertaining to bias in UX. Watch their video, [Decision Biases Affecting UX Practitioners](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/decision-biases-ux-practitioners/), to learn how to mitigate your own biases. 




  ### Use bias-free, person-centered language 


  It’s important to use clear, respectful, inclusive language that’s free of stereotypes and generalizations. Our words matter, whether we’re addressing the general public or a fellow team member. Follow the guidelines below:  


  #### Ensure the terms and references you use to refer to a group are both respectful and accurate.  


  Some terms may not be accurate to describe a group, while other terms can have negative connotations. For example, [as 18F points out, the term “American Indians and Alaskan Natives” is not an all-encompassing term for Indigenous Americans](https://github.com/18F/Equity-centered-design-with-American-Indians-and-Alaska-Natives-10x/wiki/Intro-Why-Equity-Centered-Design%3F#words-that-carry-weight), as it does not include members of non-federally-recognized tribes, or Indigenous Americans who are not members of a tribe. Do your research, read the resources listed in the “Further Reading” section below, and ask members of the group in question directly if you’re in doubt.   


  #### Use people-first language. 


  [People-first language](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language/disability) is a way to respectfully acknowledge the humanity of an individual or group first, rather than the identity or condition they may experience. Examples of people-first language include “people with a mental disorder”, rather than calling someone “mentally ill”, or referring to someone as a “person without housing”, rather than as a “homeless person”. The specific terms preferred by an individual or group can vary, and do not always include people-first syntax; additionally, language is always changing. Refer to the resources in the “Further Reading” section below to better understand how to use people-first language, and always ask people directly how they wish to define themselves.   


  #### Consider avoiding the word “user” when referring to the people we serve.  


  In line with using people-first language, consider using the word “people” instead of “user” when referring to those we’re trying to help. “User” can depersonalize our intended audience, potentially reducing them to a one-dimensional data point. “People”, in contrast, acknowledges the many distinct individuals who are interacting with the services we create for them, and helps us think collectively about the multiplicity of their viewpoints and lived experiences.   


  #### Let the voices of those we serve speak for themselves.  


  When directly sharing people’s experiences and feedback, try to use direct quotes where you can, rather than interpret what they’re saying on their behalf. If you plan to share direct quotes, [refer to our guidelines on informed consent](bookmark://_Informed_consent).
