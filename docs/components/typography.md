  A clear typographic hierarchy is critical to the effective communication of
  our brand. Type should be light and well-spaced to reinforce that we are
  transparent, open, and approachable. This system uses weight, scale, and
  capitalization to convey the relative importance of each heading within a
  document. Readability and accessibility allow all users to efficiently read
  and absorb textual information.

  Avenir Next is the primary brand typeface and can be used across all formats

  Readable text allows users to efficiently read and take in textual
  information. Text that is not readable turns off readers or makes it
  challenging for them to stay focused. The following guidelines promote good
  readability.


  #### Alignment


  Typography should be set flush left. This provides the eye a constant starting
  point for each line, making text easier to read.

  #### Line height


  Ample space between lines of type promotes an open feeling and lends flow to
  body copy.


  When setting body copy, the leading should be 1.375 times the type size, or
  37.5% larger.

  #### Line length


  Comfortable line length allows the user’s eyes to flow easily from the end of
  one line to the beginning of the next.


  For a single column of text, line length should be an average of 66 characters
  per line, including spaces, but may range from 50 to 75 characters.

  #### Spacing


  White space affects how the user focuses their attention on the content. It
  makes it easier to know what to read and where to begin. Spacing between
  typographic elements should be open enough to feel light, but close enough to
  establish a proper relationship between elements.


  ##### Heading followed by body copy

  When a heading is followed by paragraph text, include 30px of space below
  Display and 15px below Headings 1–6.

  ##### Body copy followed by a heading

  When body copy is followed by a heading, include 45px of space above Heading 2
  and 30px above Headings 3–6.

  ##### Heading followed by a heading

  For stacked headings, include 30 px of space after the primary heading.

  ##### Body copy spacing

  For multiple paragraphs within the same section set the space between
  paragraphs to 15px.

  #### Text contrast


  WCA (Web Content Accessibility) standards ensure that content is accessible by
  everyone, regardless of any disability or user device.


  To ensure text remains compliant with WCAG 2.0 standards, use only these
  permitted color combinations. These options fall within the range of
  foreground/background color contrast permitted by the Section 508 guidelines.


  #### For more information:

  This color contrast tool is a useful resource for testing the compliance of
  any combination of colors in our palette.
