***For documentation requests, use the documentation request issue template instead.***
 

**Before filling out the information below, be sure you can answer "yes" to one of the following questions and be sure to include that detail in the issue:**

***Change an existing component:***
- Is the proposed change due to an accessibility or usability issue with the existing component?
- Does the change alter the existing component in only one major way (e.g., color change)? If so, consider whether if it should be a variation of the existing component rather than a replacement.

***Add a new component***
- Is the proposed component currently being used on more than one page type on [www.consumerfinance.gov](www.consumerfinance.gov)? Alternatively, can you provide examples of multiple places where the proposed component could be used?
- Are existing Design System components not sufficiently able to meet the product requirements or serve your users' needs, thus requiring the need to create a new component?
- Is the proposed component different in more than one major way from existing components in the Design System? If the proposed component is different from an existing component in only one way (e.g. color), it would likely be better to add it as a variant of the existing component.

If you were able to answer "yes" to any of the above questions, the next steps are to prepare your change request for review by adding the following information to the GitHub issue. 

***For component updates or new additions, please be sure to include the following:***

- Indicate whether you are requesting to make a change to an existing component or whether you are requesting to add a new component to the Design Sytem
- Add any data or research you have to show that the proposed change is accessibile and usable
- Supply any design and development context you have for the request (e.g., Figma concepts, code samples, etc.)
- Indicate whether you can design and build the proposed change or whether you will need someone to make the changes for you
- Draft documentation for the proposed change to be included in the Design System website (this can be added to this issue or as a comment)
