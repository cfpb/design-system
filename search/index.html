            'title': 'Accessibility',
            'description': "The following four principles, as defined by the W3C®, lay the foundation for ensuring that web content is available for all users, including users with disabilities and users on non-desktop devices. They also enable future compatibility in the event that future devices are radically different from those in use today.  Perceivable  Operable  Understandable  RobustNote: While this document can function as a checklist – and at times, it will – that isn’t the primary purpose. The goal is to foster understanding of why these guidelines are important.This guide is adapted from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, a W3C Recommendation. More info.Perceivable(View on W3C site)Information and user interface elements must be presented to users in ways that they can perceive. This includes considering individuals using assistive technology (e.g., screen readers for blind users or captions for deaf users) and the limitations of different devices (e.g., grayscale screens or muted mobile devices).Include text alternatives for non-text contentFor any content that is not text-based (images, audio, video, animations, charts, graphs, etc), provide an alternative version of that content that is text-based.  Use the alt and title attributes on images and other graphical elements.  Use the &lt;title&gt; and &lt;desc&gt; elements in SVG drawings.  Use fallback text for the &lt;object&gt; element.  Include descriptive text near images (for example, a pie chart legend with percentages of each item).  Provide transcripts of audio and video recordings.  Provide alternatives for multimedia  Multimedia such as audio, video, and animations will usually require more than just descriptive text. In most cases, the timing of text and descriptions in these files is important and should therefore be incorporated in an accessible manner.Prerecorded content  For audio-only content, provide a transcript of both spoken words and descriptions of other sounds.  For video-only content, provide an audio track or transcript that describes the video.  Combined audio and video content should accommodate alternatives for both (e.g., closed captioning or sign interpretation for audio, and an audio track or a screenplay-like document that transcribes dialog and descriptions of sounds and action for video).Live content  Closed captioning or sign language interpretation should always be available, but in some cases providing the prepared remarks or script alongside the audio/video may suffice.Organize content semanticallySemantic content allows user agents to correctly parse documents and present it to end users in a way that is appropriate for their device and medium without losing information or structure.  Use semantic HTML, including relative header tags, lists, and semantic tags like &lt;aside&gt;, and &lt;figure&gt;  Support HTML tables with semantic tags like &lt;th&gt;, &lt;thead&gt;, &lt;tbody&gt;, and &lt;caption&gt;  Mark up HTML forms with semantic tags like &lt;label&gt;, &lt;fieldset&gt;, &lt;legend&gt;, and – where appropriate – HTML5 form additions like email fields.  If the sequence of a page matters, the underlying HTML document should be in that order or the sequence should be machine-readable through another method.  Avoid text descriptions that rely on layout or other sensory items such as “click the round button” or “the image on the right.” However, note that “above” and “below” are generally understood to mean “preceding” and “after,” and as such are permissible usage.Make content easily distinguishable from its surroundingsThese guidelines help ensure that content is perceivable for sighted users.Text  Choose easy-to-read fonts.  Avoid using images of text, except for logos and images meant to represent physical documents.  Text should be able to be resized up to 200% without causing overlapping issues with other content on the page. Don’t rely on browser zoom, since some users have settings to force large type.Color  Do not use color as the only means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.  Text should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5 : 1, but there are exceptions.          For large text, a contrast ratio of only 3 : 1 is necessary. Large regular text is at least 18pt/24px, while large bold text is 14pt/18px.      Text or images of text that are either pure decoration or not visible, or are part of a logo, picture that contains significant other visual content, or inactive UI components (like disabled form controls) do not have a color contrast requirement.        The Color Contrast Checker is a good tool for testing color contrast ratios.Audio  Avoid auto-playing audio. If this is absolutely unavoidable, provide a control that allows the user to stop the audio and adjust or mute the volume.  In recorded audio, background sounds should be at least 20 dB lower than foreground sounds and speech. This does not apply to music.Operable(view on W3C site)User interface components and navigation must be operable: an interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform. Following these guidelines will guarantee that all users can navigate a website or app regardless of their input device (mouse, keyboard, touchscreen, screen reader, etc).Ensure that all content is keyboard accessibleIn general, if a website can be operated using only the keyboard, it will also be operable with less-common input devices.  All controls must be addressable by the keyboard. By default, this includes &lt;a&gt;, &lt;area&gt;, &lt;object&gt;, and all form elements. Other elements can be made addressable by applying a tabindex value.  Avoid keyboard traps. If a user can tab to an element on the page, the user needs to be able to exit that element using only the keyboard as well.  Do not rely on specific timing of individual keystrokes when implementing keyboard accessibility.Give users ample time to interact with contentYou should not use time limits. For cases in which time limits are unavoidable:  Allow users to turn off or extend the time limit to at least 10 times the default setting.  Warn users at least 20 seconds before a time limit expires and enable a time extension with a simple action, such as pressing the space bar.  If a user needs to log in again after a time limit, make sure that there is no loss of data.Avoid interrupting users  Avoid popups or other modal dialogs that haven not been prompted by explicit user action or are alerting the user about something that is time-sensitive.  Allow users to pause, stop, or hide anything moving, blinking, or scrolling on the screen if the motion lasts longer than 5 seconds.  Allow users to pause, stop, hide, or control the frequency of auto-updating information.Do not create designs or interactions that may cause seizuresNothing on the page should flash more than 3 times in 1 second.Help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are  Allow users to bypass blocks of content that appear repeatedly on a website, like navigation, with a “skip to main content” or similar link.  Use titles that describe a webpage’s topic or purpose.  Include descriptive section headings to organize content.  Unless content is a step in a process, provide more than one way to access it, such as through browsing and search.  Provide a breadcrumb trail or other way for the user to identify their location in the site on every page.  Use descriptive link text. Avoid calls to action like “click here” or “read more.”Manage focusWhen users navigate a webpage using the keyboard or another alternative input device, only one element on the page will be in focus at a given time.  If the order of controls on a page matters, make sure they will be focused in that order when navigating by keyboard.  Make sure there is a visible indicator on screen of which element has focus. This may be an optional mode, but it should be turned on if the user begins to navigate with the keyboard.  If a user action causes a modal dialog to appear on screen, make sure the focus is moved to that dialog or area. When the dialog is dismissed, re-focus back to the original control or to some other logical place in the document.Understandable(view on W3C site)Users must be able to comprehend content and how to operate an interface.Create text content that is machine- and human-readable  Specify the language of the content in a machine-readable way. Generally, this means using &lt;html lang=\"en-us\"&gt; or the equivalent for another language. This will help with translation software and ensures that screen readers will use the correct pronunciation.  If part of a document is in a different language from the overall language of the document, specify this with something like &lt;span lang=\"fr\"&gt;.  Where possible, provide a way for users to find definitions of unusual words and phrases, especially jargon.  Make the meaning of abbreviations and acronyms available, either directly in the text, such as “Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)”, or in a machine-readable way, like &lt;abbr title=\"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\"&gt;CFPB&lt;/abbr&gt;).  Write text to an eighth-grade comprehension level, excluding proper names and titles, where possible. If that is not an option, provide a simplified version of the text nearby.  For hard-to-pronounce words, consider including the pronunciation.Develop sites that behave in a predictable way  Related webpages should have a consistent navigation structure and layout.  Components that perform the same action should be labelled the same way.Maintain contextAvoid changing a user’s context without an explicit request from the user, like clicking a button. If an automatic context change is necessary, warn the user in advance, and give them an opportunity to stop it.A few examples of context changes:  Submitting a form  Moving focus to a different element  Popping open a help dialog box  Launching a new window  Following a link  Reloading most of the content on a pageRobust(View on W3C site)Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. A robust site will be broadly compatible with past, current, and future web browsers and devices.Follow standard web best practicesThis means using standard HTML markup. If complex widgets are required, use WAI-ARIA to make the use, states, and properties clear to browsers and assistive technologies.  Make sure your HTML validates.  Use unique IDs on individual pages.  Avoid deprecated or proprietary markup.  Make sure states and properties of elements are machine readable.Note that this is specific to HTML and does not include CSS.",

About 1 in 12 men with Northern European ancestry have green/red color blindness.Instead of green/red, the teal/red color combination should used instead for pro/con, yes/no, positive/negative relationships. This both improves accessibility associated with color blindness, and also leaves the CFPB green color to represent the brand.This is an example of a visualization using the green/red combination, and how it can appear to someone with red/green color blindness:This is an example of a visualization using the teal/red combination, and how it can appear to someone with red/green color blindness:  Do not use color as the only means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.  Text should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5 : 1, but there are exceptions.          For large text, a contrast ratio of only 3 : 1 is necessary. Large regular text is at least 18pt/24px, while large bold text is 14pt/18px.      Text or images of text that are either pure decoration or not visible, or are part of a logo, picture that contains significant other visual content, or inactive UI components (like disabled form controls) do not have a color contrast requirement.

A white or 5% gray background can be used to highlight the section from the page background.The entire bar is actionable. The header should clearly indicate what the user will see when the content is expanded (it should not be a call to action). Expand icons stay aligned at the top of the row when the title breaks to multiple lines.GroupWhen expandable sections are used in a group, they are stacked vertically, with each row sharing its top or bottom stroke with the adjacent row. In this use case, expandables have no background color of their own, but match whatever color they are used on (this would typically be a white page or 5% gray well). Title text should be consistent across a group of expandables.",

The Show/Hide label can be hidden at narrower screen widths to prevent titles prematurely breaking onto multiple lines and to reduced visual clutter.ExpandedThe content of an expandable can contain normal paragraphs, headings, lists, wells, and images.Expandables can make use of an optional stroke under the title when expanded. The title stroke can help to define the title from the expanded content for longer sections of text. It should be indented left and right to match the text within the expandable section.In the default mode, users are able to have multiple sections of an expandable group expanded at the same time, which allows users to easily compare information that is available in different sections.",

It’s meant to call attention to a related piece of content that might be new or otherwise relevant to—but not directly a part of—the main content on the page, the primary intended user action, or the user journey.The goal of the FCM is to have the user do one of three things: learn something (usually by navigating to other content), watch something, or download something (a printable tool or resource). Because this content is being featured temporarily, and not meant to be permanent, it shouldn’t be seen as integral to the page, meaning the content could be changed or removed from the page without taking away vital information the user needs or interrupting the user journey. Therefore, this module is not intended to support the site IA as the primary, permanent location for content.FCMs appear below the title and introductory paragraph on a page, and retain that position on all screen sizes. FCMs can appear on any page type, though they are best suited for pages third level and below in the site map. They are designed to accommodate pages with either a left-hand navigation or right-hand sidebar.Use a featured content module (FCM) when you want to highlight something that’s:      Timely: Highlights a new tool or development. Keep in mind: When you remove dated content from a FCM, make sure you’re not getting rid of the only way users can navigate to it. Make sure to plan a permanent home for the content.        Impactful: Lets people know immediately how the content will affect them, how they can use it, and how it might enhance their understanding of—or experience with—the primary page content.        Localized: New content that specifically applies to people in a specific geographic area; it may be important for that audience to see their specific content first, and when it’s removed from the page it won’t disrupt the usual user flow.        Unique: Content that is specifically in the Bureau’s “wheelhouse” because of our position as an approachable, trusted, unbiased authority.  When to use  When content is new or relevant to—but not directly a part of—the main content on the page  When content needs to be highlighted because it’s timely, impactful, or unique to the BureauWhen other options are better      When the content is an integral, long-term part of the intended user journey, then it should have a more permanent home on the page.

They are a “mini story” and never simply a dominant visual.      Headings should be as succinct as possible and 35 characters or less (including spaces).        Descriptions should be action-oriented and let the user know what they will get out of the featured content and how it’s related to the main page content, not just what it is. Descriptions should be 160 characters or less (including spaces).        Links serve as a call-to-action, so they should begin with an action verb like “explore,” “read,” “learn,” or “discover.” When using an action verb, be specific and tie the action back to the content and what the user will get from it. As a best practice, only include up to one link in a FCM. Link text should be 35 characters or less (including spaces).        Do not include a link with a video FCM. In a FCM that features video, the desired action is for the user to play the video, so the play button serves as a visual call-to-action. This makes it especially important for the description in the FCM to be action-oriented. Encourage users to take the action of watching the video, and relate directly back to the video content and what they’ll get out of it.  Text is full-width and displayed above the visual in the default/mobile view. When creating a static image for the visual, it should be 1076px × 606px (a 16:9 aspect ratio), which is 2x the rendered width at the maximum size at which the visual will be seen (on a 600px wide display).",

As available width dips below the maximum page width, the text area shrinks in width while the visual maintains a fixed width of 270px. That means that the height and aspect ratio of the visual will change as the screen shrinks, and the image will be cropped between 16% and 29% from each side.At larger screen sizes, the image moves to the right of the text, occupying a fixed width of 270px (equal to 3 of 12 columns at max page width). By default, the left edge of the image is anchored to the left side of the visual’s 270px-wide area, and the right side is cropped off. The aspect ratio of the visual area increases as screen size increases, resulting in slightly different image cropping at different screen sizes, but the left edge of the image remains anchored in view. The full height of the image is always in view; the top and bottom are never cropped. See below for modifiers that change the image’s horizontal anchoring.",

            'title': 'Forms',
            'description': "Web forms provide an incredible advantage over paper forms in their potential for accessibility, usability, and operational efficiency, but when designed without users in mind, they can lose many of these benefits. In this guide, we’ve outlined several ways to ensure the best possible user experience.This page is under active development. Information is being moved into it from this page:  http://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/page-components/form-fields.htmlChoosing a form structureThe structure of your form should fit with the ways in which your users will want to use it.Ask yourself:  Will your users want to move through the form in a fixed order, or one of their choosing?  Will they be able to complete the form in a single go?  Will their answers affect other parts of the form?  Will they want to go back and review or change answers to previous questions?  Will they need to add or remove items from a list, or change the order of things?  How many parties are involved in the form?  Do any parts of the form take place offline?  At what point is the form regarded as complete?How you answer these questions will help you decide how to structure the form. It can help to think in terms of levels: sections, subsections, groups, etc. Try not to worry about how those levels should be represented in the interface until you have a broader understanding of the overall structure.For example, on a website, you might choose to have one section per page, or multiple sections per page. It depends on what’s going to work best for your users.Example structuresOption 1: Single pageAll sections are positioned on a single page.The good  There’s only one submit button to press  A single URL gives access to all form fields  It doesn’t force a fixed order of completion  You benefit from context of neighboring sections  Progress is self-evidentThe bad  Long forms can be overwhelming and off-putting  It’s less well suited to branching or non-linear flow  How do you save partial progress?  Can be harder to track analytics like drop-off ratesOption 2: WizardEach section goes on its own page.The good  It’s easier to handle branching and dependencies between sections  It’s easier to let the user save progress  A long form can feel more manageable  Easier to guide a user through an unfamiliar process  Easier to capture analytics like drop-off rates for each sectionThe bad  Can be harder for users to see where they are within the form  It can slow users down as they have to click and load each section  You lose the contextual information from neighboring sections  Harder for users to review and edit previous sections  There’s no single place for users to go back and edit their data  Not a natural fit for non-linear processes like looping, adding and removingOption 3: Accordion formAll sections on a single page, but each new section only appears once the previous section has been completed. Done well, option 3 is a hybrid of the other two that has benefits of both the other options.Within this hybrid option there are still some important design decisions to make, for example:  Will future questions be shown in any way or will you only see the questions you’ve answered?  What happens if you go back and edit a previous question?  Does the current question stay open or closed?  How do you get back to the current question once you’ve edited a previous one?  Do you lose all your answers to questions that follow the one you go back to edit?The good  Can handle branching and dependencies between sections  Can easily review and edit previous questions  Can help guide a user through an unfamiliar process  User still benefits from some surrounding context  Progress is clearThe bad  Implementation and interface is more complexOption 4: HybridFor more complicated forms, some combination of the other options might be your best bet. Done well, this can give you the benefits of both the single page and wizard approaches. It also allows you to create a sense of rhythm to the overall flow, which can help users understand when they have moved into a different part of the form, and break up the monotony of filling in forms.As always, these design decisions must have a strong, user-centred rationale behind them.Helping usersYou should be aiming for a service that’s so intuitive people don’t need any help in using it. If you find yourself explaining the interface within the interface it’s a sign that something has gone wrong.Sometimes though, people are going to need extra help. Many government forms involve concepts and terminology that people will be unfamiliar with. Some of this stuff takes a lot of explaining, so we need a way of providing contextual help of varying degrees of detail throughout a form.Methods for providing extra help:INLINE HELPShort, snappy text, positioned near the part of the interface it refers to. If it’s something that everyone needs to know, make it permanently visible.PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSUREA fancy phrase for hiding stuff until it’s clicked on. Used carefully this is a good way of keeping the interface free from potentially confusing clutter. Only use this for help that’s intended for a small subset of your audience (say, less than 10%).FIELD MASKINGWhen a specific data entry format is required, as for phone numbers, dates, and social security numbers, provide an example of the required format (e.g., XXX-XX-XXXX).RICH CONTEXTUAL HELPSometimes you need to give users access to supporting content, in case they’re unfamiliar with the terminology or concepts involved in the form. This kind of content should probably exist as a page outside of the form, and then be repurposed in some way within the form.Communicating errorsDespite providing the best possible helper text and contextual help, you should still plan for when users make errors when filling out your forms.Tips for communicating errors:INDICATE OPTIONAL AND/OR REQUIRED FIELDSIf most of the fields are required, leave them alone and just mark the optional fields as optional. If most of the fields are optional, leave them alone and just mark the required fields as required. If it’s close to a tie, go with whichever choice might be better for your users.COMBINE FIELD-LEVEL ERROR TEXT WITH A PAGE-LEVEL ERROR MESSAGEThis is particularly important for accessibility. If someone is using a screenreader to navigate the page, a digest of errors at the top of the page will help them understand which fields need fixing. Including anchor links to the invalid fields will allow them to find and fix the error without re-navigating the entire form.BE DESCRIPTIVE WITH ERROR TEXTTell the user what caused the error and how to correct it.VALIDATE FIELDS BEFORE THE USER SUBMITSCheck for errors as the user fills out the form (e.g., using javascript) and provide inline messaging with instructions for how to correct the error.Also consider including affirmative inline validation (such as green checkmarks) for required text fields, especially those that require specific formats or character counts, such as Zip Codes and passwords.Saving progressIf the average time to complete a form is more than you can reasonably expect your users to spend in a single session, then you need to provide a way for them to save their progress.The same goes if the session is likely to be interrupted for some reason. For example, if the user is suddenly asked for information which they might not have immediately on hand (a way to mitigate this is to warn users if they’re going to be asked for that kind of information). Another example is that the user might start a form on their mobile device and want to continue filling it out on their desktop computer.Setting expectationsThe further in to a form someone gets, the more time they have invested in it and the greater their annoyance if they have to abandon it for some reason.Be honest about what you’re offering users, and what you’re not offering them. In particular, people need to know up front about any:  Costs involved  Waiting periods or delays  Uncommon or hard-to-find infomation they’ll need to provide  Constraints on who can complete the form (age, nationality, etc)  Equipment that will be required (e.g., a printer)  Non-digital parts of the formUse common sense, though. Don’t try to make everyone read a page of terms and conditions before they start (they won’t).The best approach is to meet (or exceed) people’s expectations. For example, if your delivery times are typical and you accept all the usual payment methods then you won’t need to warn everyone about them up front.Keeping it simpleEvery request for information from the user:  Requires additional physical and cognitive effort  Creates another opportunity for them to get something ‘wrong’  Increases the time it takes to complete the form  Increases the perception that the service is invasive  Increases the risk that users will give up or fail to submit your formAsking for information because ‘it might be useful’ or ‘it helps with our record keeping’ should be considered against all of these factors.AttributionThis guide on effective forms has been adapted from the guide Designing transactions in the GOV.UK Government Service Design Manual, which is licensed under the Open Government License v2.0.",

            'behavior': "SVG icon basicsThe cf-icon component provides Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) icons. This component can be used by itself, but is designed to work with the Design System.We subscribe to the guidance offered by Chris Coyier in his article, “A Pretty Good SVG Icon System”, in which he concludes, “Just include the icons inline.”Because including raw SVG code is not necessarily pretty or user-friendly, we encourage using your templating system to include them by reference.  Note: Jinja2, the templating language that cfgov-refresh uses, has a near-identical syntax for includes, but it requires that the path be enclosed in quotation marks, like so: {% include 'icons/download.svg' %}.The filenames of the SVGs included with cf-icons match the names in the Icon library section. There are duplicate SVG files for each alias, as well.  Note to contributors: If any icon is ever updated, you must be sure to also update each of the alias SVGs.What the Less is doingIf you look in cf-icons.less, below the aforementioned sizing variable, you’ll see this simple rule:.cf-icon-svg {    height: @cf-icon-height;    vertical-align: text-top;    fill: currentColor;    …}Referring back to the example above, you can see that we have encoded class=\"cf-icon-svg\" in the root element of each of our SVG icons. As a result, the Less rule gets applied to all of the SVGs on the page, just like any other HTML element.We start by limiting the size of the SVG to a proportion of the text height, using the @cf-icon-height variable’s em value. To align the canvas of the icon with the canvas of neighboring text, we set vertical-align: text-top;. Finally, setting fill: currentColor; tells the SVG to set its path’s fill color to match the color value of its parent element.CaveatsThere are two modifications based on restrictions in Internet Explorer 8 and 9 (IE8/IE9).First, IE8 does not support fill: currentColor. Typically the fallback would be to use a PNG image, but due to the inability to know what the background or text color of its surroundings are, we found it better to fall back to the paired text with no icon.Second, IE9 displays SVGs as full width by default (not the paths, just the SVG container). To eliminate this issue we’ve set the width of the SVGs to match the height. The whitespace to the left or right may not be quite accurate, but we determined this is an acceptable difference for a legacy browser like IE9.Inline SVG backgroundIn some cases we embed an SVG as a background image. To accomplish this, a custom less plugin is used to inject the SVG icon source file inline into the CSS background-image property. This is exposed via a mixin, .u-svg-inline-bg( @name ), where @name is the SVG icon canonical name.",

Illustrations should appear natural, but stylized. Do not scale-up or collage minicons or isocons for use in illustrations. Minicons can be used as graphic details when scaled appropriately.Illustrations should be compositionally balanced with related headers and text. Reduce “floating” by bleeding illustrations off the edges of the graphic. Make use of layering and subtle, vector-based background patterns to help ground the illustration. Shadows are appropriate when objects overlap but should not extend outside of objects.Do not use negative space to define outlines.FormAll illustrations should be based on commonly used geometric shapes like circles, triangles, beams, and rectangles.To stylize illustrations according to CFPB standards, use relative sizing on stroke weights with a rounded end cap. For curved lines, the stylized stroke is recommended throughout illustrations.Shading and highlightsObjects should be lit from the upper-left side. This is consistent with the beam in our logo. The overall placement of highlights and shading should be carefully decided by the designer and consistent throughout the project.Shading should be achieved using subtle, solid tints, not gradients, textures, multiply, or blurs.There are two types of highlights available for illustrations; curved and diagonal. The curved highlight is recommended when the object is round. Diagonal highlights are mostly used in rectangular objects. They are also frequently used to show reflections. To create a diagonal highlight, a tint of the background color is cast from the top-right corner of an object at a 45º angle.ShadowsShadows are created using a darker tint of the background color. They are appropriate when objects overlap but should not extend outside of objects. In top-facing illustrations, shadows around objects can be used to create realism.The overall placement of shadows should be carefully decided by the designer and consistent throughout the project.",

            'title': 'Integrating the Design System into your project',
            'description': "The Design System provides a set of modular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript patterns that can be used both collectively and individually. There are several ways to integrate it into your project:  Installing a single component with npm or yarn  Using the generator  Using Less  Downloading the compiled CSSOur recommended workflow if you are starting a new codebase is to use the generator to scaffold out a new Design System project. This allows you to pick and choose your modules as well as providing a solid front end build process.Installing a single component with npm or yarnJust want one or two CF components and not the entire framework?Simply install and @import only the components you need.Install with yarn or npmPick one:yarn add cf-buttons cf-iconsornpm install cf-buttons cf-iconsImport CSS@import (less) \"node_modules/@cfpb/cfpb-buttons/src/cfpb-buttons.less\";@import (less) \"node_modules/@cfpb/cfpb-icons/src/cfpb-icons.less\";/* the rest of your stylesheet… */  NOTE: Be sure to run the Less files through  Autoprefixer,  or your compiled CSS might not work perfectly in older browsers.Import JavaScriptimport Expandable from '@cfpb/cfpb-expandables/src/Expandable'';Expandable.init( document.querySelector( '#container' ) );Using the generatorTo use the generator, you will need Node.js,Yeoman, and Gulp.Installing dependenciesNode.js can be downloaded and installed directly from the Node website, or by using a package manager for your system. At the CFPB we use Homebrew. To install the dependencies:brew install node  # if installing node with Homebrewnpm install --global gulp yo generator-cfScaffolding out a projectTo create a new project, create a directory, cd into that directory, and run the yo cf command:mkdir my-awesome-projectcd my-awesome-projectyo cfThe generator will prompt you to complete information about the project and choose the Design System modules you would like to use.Navigating the project folderOnce the generator has finished you’ll have a folder full of files and folders.Here’s a quick guide on working with these files:  Run npm run build to process the files in src and output them to dist.  To view your site, go to the dist directory and start a local server: cd dist &amp;&amp; python -m SimpleHTTPServer. You can now navigate to localhost:8000 in your web browser.  Edit files within the src directory and re-run npm run build to view changes.Editing the Less and JSThe generator has created a starter Less file at src/static/css/main.less.This file includes all of the necessary imports needed for Capital Framework.There is also a starter JavaScript file at src/static/js/main.js.Both main.less and main.js are already wired into Gruntfile.js (or gulp/tasks/if you selected gulp) so compiling is as easy as running npm run build. It alsocopies files from src into dist, which will update what you see at localhost:8000/.Theming / CustomizingYou can override component UI colors within src/static/css/cf-theme-overrides.less.This is already set up for you and gets imported by main.less.If you would like to use your own color palette simply replace the contents ofbrand-palette.less with your own color variables,then update cf-theme-overrides.less by overriding each UI color variablewith a color from brand-palette.less or any color of your choosing.The same applies when you need to add custom styles to your project.You can add any custom .less files to your project that you may need,just remember to import them in main.less using the correct path.Using LessIf you don’t want to use the generator,you can just download the source files and import them into your project.  NOTE: Be sure to run the Less files through  Autoprefixer,  or your compiled CSS will  not work perfectly in older browsers.Run npm install capital-framework. This will download Capital Framework to yourproject’s node_modules directory. You can then import the framework intoyour application’s primary Less file:@import (less) \"node_modules/capital-framework/src/capital-framework.less\";/* the rest of your stylesheet… */Just want one or two CF components and not the entire framework?Simply install and @import only the components you need.npm install cf-buttons cf-icons@import (less) \"node_modules/cf-buttons/src/cfpb-buttons.less\";@import (less) \"node_modules/cf-icons/src/cfpb-icons.less\";/* the rest of your stylesheet… */Downloading the compiled CSSCapital Framework’s compiled CSS can be downloaded here.Download it and copy the files found in the dist/ directory to your project.Use standard &lt;link&gt; and &lt;script&gt; tags.&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;    &lt;title&gt;My Awesome Project&lt;/title&gt;    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"capital-framework.min.css\"&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;    &lt;!-- Your project's HTML goes here. --&gt;    &lt;script src=\"capital-framework.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;",

It’s focused on navigation and content.  It’s a good and ever-improving experience.More detailed version of design principles  Our mega menu is based on industry standards around web development and user expectations around interactions. The mega menu works:  across our supported browsers,  across different browser sizes (and not just device form factors),  across the spectrum of user ability levels or technology familiarity, and  in line with the standard interactions for different assistive techniques.      Our mega menu is designed to be equitable and provides full navigational support to all users. This includes users with physical disabilities, hearing and visual impairments, mental disorders, cognitive disabilities, or seizure disorders. Our mega menu is accessible and usable by all who use assistive technologies regardless of what type of disability they might have or their percentage within our larger user base. We do not ignore the needs of the few to only focus on the many.        Our mega menu fully aligns with the WCAG core accessibility principles known as POUR: every part of it is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for all users.        Our mega menu is built mobile-first with semantic code to focus on the content and navigation elements within it. It’s designed to work with the interaction defaults of both JAWS and Apple VoiceOver. The visual design supports all of these factors and doesn’t supersede them.        We maintain a good mega menu experience for our users and actively work to improve it. All the designers and developers in the department read, share, and know where to find basic information about the mega menu. We are aware of its guidelines, its complexities, and what traps to avoid falling into when modifying it. We monitor and publish our site analytics for the mega menu on a regular basis to make sure that we’re continually aware of how users are using it and able to make necessary adjustments over time as needed. We also usability test the mega menu with external users as a part of the monitoring process.  The consumerfinance.gov website mega menu is composed of five verticals: Consumer Tools, Practitioner Resources, Data &amp; Research, Policy &amp; Compliance, and About Us. The visual layout, spacing, and some portion of the content guidelines will change in the near future, as we monitor analytics information.",

            'content_guidelines': "Maximum number of linksAnalytics review suggests that 7 links per column should be the maximum, assuming space on top of the menu for a section overview page.  Around 70% of desktop visitors to consumerfinance.gov have a screen height of 768 px or more. At that screen height, 7 is the maximum number of links that users see before items below are cut off, assuming 5 links around 20 characters or less with spaces, and 2 links up to 35-40 characters with spaces. This also assumes no extra browser chrome, such as an address or bookmark bar, and flush placement of browser window to top of screen.  Research also shows 7 is around the maximum number of items that one can scan and comfortably hold in short-term memory. The idea is to minimize cognitive load by grouping like items into categories that can be easily scanned and that line up with the user’s mental models.  For a vertical with two sections, one section can have 14 links maximum, the other section up to 7 links maximum, given space for a featured item, which occupies the fourth column. (There should be no more than three main sections in a vertical, but it’s easier for users to scan up to two.)  If a section of links spans two columns, the number of links should be evenly distributed between columns.Link character counts  Links should be 20 characters or less, including spaces.  Two exceptions per column can be made for longer links. These longer links can be 30-35 characters with spaces maximum (e.g. “Managing someone else’s money”).Editorial guidelines  Links should be in alphabetical order and written in title case  Ampersands (“&amp;”) should be used in place of the word “and”  See previous section for link limits and character count guidance  Links should generally be straightforward and self-explanatory, avoiding jargon or brand names that might be difficult for users to understand  Links should generally go to consumerfinance.gov pages only  Links should reflect page titles, but don’t necessarily have to duplicate them verbatim",

They can be triggered by a user interaction (like pressing a button to “save”) or without an interaction (like a timeout warning after a period of inactivity).InterruptionUse modals to force the user to complete a task or make a decision that requires their full attention outside of the main workflow. A critical piece of this scenario is that you need the workflow to be interrupted to be effective. If not, explore other UI elements to accomplish the goal.Examples of when to use modals  Confirm an action that can’t be undone, such as “Are you sure you want to delete this?  Display a warning that something is about to expire or timeout  Save a form that requires inputs separate from the main workflow, like entering a “Save as” file name  Focus attention on the need to accept or acknowledge something before the user can proceed",

This could be either the first form field in the modal window or the primary action button.Scrolling within a modalModal windows should not scroll. If a modal contains enough information to require scrolling, use an alternative method of displaying content, such as a different UI element or another content page.Closing a modalActions inside modals should be clearly marked. There should be a clear path forward (“continue”) and back (“cancel”), in addition to a clearly labeled way to close the modal without taking any action at all. When a modal window is closed, return focus to the last active element on the page behind the modal.Modal windows are always closable by clicking or tapping:  A delete minicon or label in the upper right corner  The next action button or link  Anywhere outside the modal window  ESC key on a keyboardCreating accessible behaviorsKeyboard access should be limited to only interacting with the modal dialog once it is visible.  The close minicon needs to be accessible from a keyboard.  The escape key should also close the modal.  The enter key should should be mapped to any submission forms in the modal.Provide separate focus and hover states for the close minicon and any “next” action buttons.The find function (ctrl+F) will not search information contained within a modal window.Include offscreen instructions that describe the modal dialog and how to interact with it.Specific development directions  Modal windows should be marked with aria-hidden=”true” and toggled to false when visible and given the role=dialog ARIA role.  When the modal dialog is displayed, the main content of the page should be marked with aria-hidden=”true” to prevent screen readers from interacting with it.  Add role=”alertdialog” to the modal window.  Code the close minicon using a button element for more semantic markup.  The heading of the modal dialog should use an H1 tag.  Offscreen interaction instructions should use aria-labelledby attribute.",

If letters are entered in a date field, if an email address is missing the “@” sign, let the user know right away by showing a field-level error on blur.That said, it’s a good idea to always validate on the server side even if you use client-side validation for formatting checks. That’s because JavaScript validation may not work on all clients; JavaScript errors could occur no matter the client; and JS validation can easily be bypassed, which raises security concerns.In general, the best practice for server-side validation is to mark errors with both form-level and field-level errors.",

Labels should precede titles (e.g. “Table 1: The title given to this table”).Long column labelsConsider using fixed columns or truncation for column labels that are significantly longer than the expected width of the data.Unit of measurementMake sure to indicate the unit of measurement. In terms of placement, if the units are the same across columns, indicate the unit of measurement in the title or someplace noticeable above the table.Alternatively, if the table uses at most two units of measurement, consider using asterisks following the column label, and define the unit of measurement below the table.If units differ from column to column, the standard is to list the unit of measure in parentheses following the column label.

When possible, be even more explicit with the width by dividing it into known character counts. For instance, social security number should be three characters, then two, then four. Be mindful of not getting too restrictive, however. This approach could work for phone numbers, but only if international numbers are not permitted.These types of inputs should always be smaller widths:  Middle initial  Date, month, or year  State abbreviationText should be in sentence case.Use placeholder text for formatting examples only.

In most cases, the timing of text and descriptions in these files is important and should therefore be incorporated in an accessible manner.PRERECORDED CONTENT  For audio-only content, provide a transcript of both spoken words and descriptions of other sounds.  For video-only content, provide an audio track or transcript that describes the video.  Combined audio and video content should accommodate alternatives for both (e.g., closed captioning or sign interpretation for audio, and an audio track or a screenplay-like document that transcribes dialog and descriptions of sounds and action for video).LIVE CONTENT  Closed captioning or sign language interpretation should always be available, but in some cases providing the prepared remarks or script alongside the audio/video may suffice.Make content easily distinguishable from its surroundingsThese guidelines help ensure that content is perceivable for sighted users.AUDIO  Avoid auto-playing audio. If this is absolutely unavoidable, provide a control that allows the user to stop the audio and adjust or mute the volume.  In recorded audio, background sounds should be at least 20 dB lower than foreground sounds and speech. This does not apply to music.Do not create designs or interactions that may cause seizures  Nothing on the page should flash more than 3 times in 1 second.",
