  <h3>Content guidelines</h3>


  Where possible, design your forms to only include required fields. If it’s not
  required, ask yourself if it’s really necessary to include at all. Add
  instructions at the top of the form to clearly indicate that all fields are
  required unless otherwise noted. If a field is optional, indicate it with
  inline helper text, as shown here. Don’t indicate which fields are required;
  that would only introduce redundant visual noise.


  Try not to design forms consisting mainly of optional fields. If you must do
  so, mark required field labels only with inline helper text.
accessibility: >-
  For screen reader accessibility, consider using the aria-describedby attribute
  for helper text, which gives screen readers users the information if they need
  while allowing more flexibility with placement.
