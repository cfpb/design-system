  Filterable list page types are used to house searchable lists of articles,
  documents, or other resources and publications.


  Most filterable list pages use the browse page template layout, though in rare
  cases they can be housed on a sublanding page template layout. The filterable
  list itself is composed of post preview components that link to individual
  document detail pages.


  This page is under active development. Information is being moved into it from

  #### Use case


  ##### WHEN TO USE


  * When asking users to look through more than 20 articles, documents, or
  resources.

  * Additional content may be included before or after the filterable list, but
  it is not encouraged. The filterable list should be the focus of the page.


  #### Content guidelines


  * Text introduction and/or full width text should be used to introduce the
  documents that are being filtered.

  * If any of the filtering labels are technical or require further explanation
  (such as categories), a full width text element can be placed above the filter
  control panel to provide further explanation.

  * Required elements: filter control panel, list of items (displayed as post
  preview items) and pagination.


  #### Behavior


  Responsive behavior follows the pattern of the base page types (sublanding
  page or browse page).
