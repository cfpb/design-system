description: The [Design System](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/) (DS) is
  an open-source resource for designing and developing at the CFPB. It’s
  intended to help teams produce consistent, effective and accessible products
  for the American public, and it holds the code and design specs we want to
  encourage the use of.

          * The Design System is a product

          * There are products that use the Design System, of which [www.consumerfinance.gov](www.consumerfinance.gov) is one

          * Its documentation applies to all of our current and future products and services

          * Patterns and components "graduate" into the Design System

          * It's the foundation, but not the limits

          * It's the default, but not the only (or every) option

          * Patterns that were created for specific products (and are not for global use) should not be included

          our Design System code

          * Doing so would bake the CMS choice into our design patterns, and we don't want to do that
