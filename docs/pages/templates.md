  <p class="lead-paragraph">Our page templates reflect common page types that we
  use within our content management system. They are built from our library of
  components.</p>


  <p class="lead-paragraph">They are documented here primarily for easy

  also serve as inspiration for anyone creating a system of components.</p>
