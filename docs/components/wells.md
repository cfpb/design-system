  Wells are used to highlight specific information within a designated section
  of a page. This breaks up the flow of content on the page and helps to
  emphasize and set apart the content that is included.

  #### Use cases

  Use sparingly to attract users’ attention to a concise piece of content.
  Ideally, content within a well should not take up more than a third of page
  content.

  Full width text, images, and embedded media (like video) may be placed within
  wells, however, if content includes imagery also consider the [Featured
  Content Module](/design-system/components/featured-content-module).


  #### Content guidelines


  * Grey wells should be used to feature content or specific calls to action;
  text should be succinct.


  * A grey well will help visually set apart the content within it, so use it to
  draw attention to that content.


  * Grey wells should take up less than a third of a page.


  * Currently, grey wells should contain single column content only.



  Types of atoms you can place in a well include:  


  * Headings (H2 - H5).


  * Text (including bullets and numbered lists).


  * Links.


  * Headings should be as succinct as possible and 35 characters or less
  (including spaces).


  #### Behavior


  ##### Breakpoints 900+

  Page with a right sidebar

  Browse page with left nav

  ##### Breakpoints 900 and under

  Wells are full width. At breakpoints 600 and under there are slight padding
  adjustments to maximize real estate on smaller displays.
