We encourage you to use this framework in your own projects and to contribute back.\n#### Browser support & testing\nWe actively test Capital Framework components in the following browsers:  \n\n  - Chrome  \n  - Firefox  \n  - Safari  \n  - Edge  \n  - IE 8+  \n  - Safari on iOS  \n  - Chrome for Android  \n\n#### Accessibility\nWe deeply value accessible web products and work to ensure that all of our components comply with Section 508 rules for creating accessible software and websites. We actively test components to ensure that they are keyboard and screen reader friendly.\n#### A NOTE ABOUT OUR STANDARDS\nThese standards reflect our latest thinking and are just beginning to be incorporated into the CFPB's most recent projects. See these standards in practice in eRegs, Consumer Response, and HMDA.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"docs/getting-started/why-we-are-sharing-this.md","sha":"a6bdf02ad882ac489ea5511c771e78286eaf3a4c"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2019-08-21T19:35:52.092Z"}
