  ## Getting started


  Our [general principles](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/general-principles) form the strategic underpinnings for the CFPB’s design and development standards. Our [accessibility principles](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/guidelines/accessibility-principles) lay the foundation for ensuring that our web content is available for all users.

  ### Patterns
