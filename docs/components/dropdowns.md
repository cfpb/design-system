  <h3>Use cases</h3>

  While dropdowns are easy to implement, they aren’t always the best choice from
  a usability perspective.


  Use dropdowns when:

  * You have a long list of finite options. If the list is shorter than around
  six items, radio buttons might work better. If the options include something
  open ended, a text input field is better.

  * You need structured data for a long list. For instance, an open text field
  for “state” could be entered as Missouri or MO. So if this needs to be
  standardized, a dropdown facilitates this standardization.

  * The list options are familiar to the user. A dropdown is not a good place to
  introduce new or complicated terms or concepts. For instance, if the question
  is “What’s your favorite color of the rainbow,” a dropdown could be a good
  choice. The options are familiar and there are more than six. You don’t want
  the user to have to read and absorb a lot of new information in a dropdown.
accessibility: >-
  Keep in mind that dropdowns behave differently on various mobile devices,
  taking up different amounts of real estate and requiring different
  interactions. Mobile also doesn’t allow for the use of typeahead to navigate
  quickly to an item in a list, so navigating long lists can be especially
  cumbersome.


  From an accessibility standpoint, browser defaults for multiple select
  components require the use of a mouse (e.g. holding down the control key and
  clicking several items). The default components are a poor choice for the
  visually impaired. If a multi-select component is desired, use custom
  JavaScript to make it accessible.
