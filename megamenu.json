The mega menu works:\n\n* across our supported browsers,\n* across different browser sizes (and not just device form factors),\n* across the spectrum of user ability levels or technology familiarity, and\n* in line with the standard interactions for different assistive techniques.\n\n**It’s equitable for all.** Our mega menu is designed to provide full navigational support to all users. This includes users with physical disabilities, hearing and visual impairments, mental disorders, cognitive disabilities, or seizure disorders. Our mega menu is accessible and usable by all who use assistive technologies regardless of what type of disability they might have or their percentage within our larger user base. We do not ignore the needs of the few to only focus on the many.\n\n**It’s standardized.** Our mega menu fully aligns with the WCAG core accessibility principles known as POUR: every part of it is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for all users.\n\n**It’s focused on navigation and content.** Our mega menu is built mobile-first with semantic code to focus on the content and navigation elements within it. It’s designed to work with the interaction defaults of both JAWS and Apple VoiceOver. The visual design supports all of these factors and doesn’t supersede them.\n\n**It’s a good and ever-improving experience.** We maintain a good mega menu experience for our users and actively work to improve it. All the designers and developers in the department read, share, and know where to find basic information about the mega menu. We are aware of its guidelines, its complexities, and what traps to avoid falling into when modifying it. We monitor and publish our site analytics for the mega menu on a regular basis to make sure that we’re continually aware of how users are using it and able to make necessary adjustments over time as needed. We also usability test the mega menu with external users as a part of the monitoring process.\n\nThe [consumerfinance.gov](https://www.consumerfinance.gov) website mega menu is composed of five verticals: Consumer Tools, Practitioner Resources, Data & Research, Policy & Compliance, and About Us. **The visual layout, spacing, and some portion of the content guidelines will change in the near future, as we monitor analytics information.**","objects":{"entry":{"path":"docs/components/megamenu.md","sha":"63ed7a01addf8d17e2f4b92917ac8258317522f9"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2020-03-05T21:57:21.364Z"}
