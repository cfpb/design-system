            'description': "These are the strategic underpinnings for the CFPB’s design and development standards. They should serve as the backbone for the user experience, ensuring that the standards we set enable products that are easy to use and understand for consumers.Public service, public trustHonest, transparent design that wins the public’s trust.We establish trust through clear, concise, and approachable design that is always consumer-driven. We demonstrate transparency through our user-friendly online experiences and tools and our dedication to open-source content.Give the user controlDesign to empower users with information.The CFPB motivates consumers to take the control of their financial decision-making; our designs enable this process. Good design increases transparency and succinctly hands the user all the necessary information, giving consumers control of how they use it. Designers must rely on introspection and research to discover what path users instinctively take and then cater to those instincts.Aesthetic integrityAlign appearance with purpose.Aesthetic integrity is not merely “attractiveness;” it implies the successful integration of design and function. Appearance should align with purpose. Using clear and intuitive design creates a trustworthy tone and a powerful platform for supporting the CFPB’s mission.Maintain consistency and clarity.Maintaining consistency in design empowers users to seamlessly transfer their knowledge and skills from one product to another. Focusing on consistency helps uphold aesthetic integrity.Design with dataDesign gives voice to data, and data informs design.Because the CFPB is a data-driven organization, quantitative measures of success should be integral to the design process. Design should incorporate data to aid understanding of complex issues, and data-driven feedback should influence the design process. Succinct and compelling visualization of information gives data a voice and helps us clarify otherwise indigestible numbers.Inclusion and accessibilityDesign for the widest possible demographic with bias toward clear articulation, plain language, and intuitive design.We design to meet each consumer where he or she is. We are sensitive to experiential level, timing, and biases and aim to design experiences that are equally accessible to everyone, and equally empowering no matter what the user’s skill set or familiarity. Simple, clean designs are the most effective and wide-reaching.Coherent end-to-end user experienceUnify parts of the user experience and transition seamlessly between them.The best design guides the user’s experience from beginning-to-end and caters to his or her expectations. Navigation between sections should be intuitive and transitions should be seamless. Consistent quality and attention to detail are essential to maintain a cohesive user experience.",

For example, if you want to add a new component page, make sure you’re in the “Components” section.  Click the “+ Add new page” button at the bottom of the page.  If you haven’t already, log in to our CFPB GitHub repo.  Fill out the relevant fields of the CMS that appear on the left, a preview of your page will appear on the right. You can edit the fields on the left as needed. The rich text field will let you easily style the text, but you can use additional markdown as needed to create the page content you want.  Click “Save” at the top of the screen to save your work. Netlify will create a pull request in our public GitHub repo: https://github.com/cfpb/design-system/pulls.  Your work will not be visible until your pull request has been approved and merged.Editing pages  Navigate to the page you’d like to edit.  At the bottom of the page, click the “Edit this page” button that has a pencil icon.  If you haven’t already, log in to our CFPB GitHub repo.The left side of your screen will show the CMS fields, the right side shows a preview of the page.

Select an image from the current library or upload a new image from your computer. Note: Due to a bug in Netlify CMS, the image might not immediately appear in the preview pane.Updating navigationChange a page’s location in the side navigation by changing the “Navigation Section” field in the CMS.Updating design tokensCFPB’s design tokens are stored in a spreadsheet located in the repository’s /docs/_data folder. You can add new tokens and change existing ones by editing the file in your favorite spreadsheet software.To add a spec to a component variation’s specs tables, add the applicable component variation to column A. Use the format &lt;component-name&gt;_&lt;variation-name&gt;. For example, to add the Button background spec in the above screenshot to the first variation on the buttons component page, you would add buttons_primary-button to the row’s first cell.Column B is the human-readable name of the specification and column C is the machine-readable name of the specification (we use Less variables). The value of the specification can be added to column D. This will often be another Less variable.Columns E - M are the specifications’ values. Complete only the applicable columns. For example, our headings (h1, h2, etc.) only have Pixels and Points defined because they’re the only things needed to size a heading (pixels for websites and points for print documents). The Second and color columns are blank because time and colors don’t concern headings.",

            'title': 'Accessibility',
            'description': "The following four principles, as defined by the W3C®, lay the foundation for ensuring that web content is available for all users, including users with disabilities and users on non-desktop devices. They also enable future compatibility in the event that future devices are radically different from those in use today.  Perceivable  Operable  Understandable  RobustNote: While this document can function as a checklist – and at times, it will – that isn’t the primary purpose. The goal is to foster understanding of why these guidelines are important.This guide is adapted from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, a W3C Recommendation. More info.Perceivable(View on W3C site)Information and user interface elements must be presented to users in ways that they can perceive. This includes considering individuals using assistive technology (e.g., screen readers for blind users or captions for deaf users) and the limitations of different devices (e.g., grayscale screens or muted mobile devices).Include text alternatives for non-text contentFor any content that is not text-based (images, audio, video, animations, charts, graphs, etc), provide an alternative version of that content that is text-based.  Use the alt and title attributes on images and other graphical elements.  Use the &lt;title&gt; and &lt;desc&gt; elements in SVG drawings.  Use fallback text for the &lt;object&gt; element.  Include descriptive text near images (for example, a pie chart legend with percentages of each item).  Provide transcripts of audio and video recordings.  Provide alternatives for multimedia  Multimedia such as audio, video, and animations will usually require more than just descriptive text. In most cases, the timing of text and descriptions in these files is important and should therefore be incorporated in an accessible manner.Prerecorded content  For audio-only content, provide a transcript of both spoken words and descriptions of other sounds.  For video-only content, provide an audio track or transcript that describes the video.  Combined audio and video content should accommodate alternatives for both (e.g., closed captioning or sign interpretation for audio, and an audio track or a screenplay-like document that transcribes dialog and descriptions of sounds and action for video).Live content  Closed captioning or sign language interpretation should always be available, but in some cases providing the prepared remarks or script alongside the audio/video may suffice.Organize content semanticallySemantic content allows user agents to correctly parse documents and present it to end users in a way that is appropriate for their device and medium without losing information or structure.  Use semantic HTML, including relative header tags, lists, and semantic tags like &lt;aside&gt;, and &lt;figure&gt;  Support HTML tables with semantic tags like &lt;th&gt;, &lt;thead&gt;, &lt;tbody&gt;, and &lt;caption&gt;  Mark up HTML forms with semantic tags like &lt;label&gt;, &lt;fieldset&gt;, &lt;legend&gt;, and – where appropriate – HTML5 form additions like email fields.  If the sequence of a page matters, the underlying HTML document should be in that order or the sequence should be machine-readable through another method.  Avoid text descriptions that rely on layout or other sensory items such as “click the round button” or “the image on the right.” However, note that “above” and “below” are generally understood to mean “preceding” and “after,” and as such are permissible usage.Make content easily distinguishable from its surroundingsThese guidelines help ensure that content is perceivable for sighted users.Text  Choose easy-to-read fonts.  Avoid using images of text, except for logos and images meant to represent physical documents.  Text should be able to be resized up to 200% without causing overlapping issues with other content on the page. Don’t rely on browser zoom, since some users have settings to force large type.Color  Do not use color as the only means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.  Text should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5 : 1, but there are exceptions.          For large text, a contrast ratio of only 3 : 1 is necessary. Large regular text is at least 18pt/24px, while large bold text is 14pt/18px.      Text or images of text that are either pure decoration or not visible, or are part of a logo, picture that contains significant other visual content, or inactive UI components (like disabled form controls) do not have a color contrast requirement.        The Color Contrast Checker is a good tool for testing color contrast ratios.Audio  Avoid auto-playing audio. If this is absolutely unavoidable, provide a control that allows the user to stop the audio and adjust or mute the volume.  In recorded audio, background sounds should be at least 20 dB lower than foreground sounds and speech. This does not apply to music.Operable(view on W3C site)User interface components and navigation must be operable: an interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform. Following these guidelines will guarantee that all users can navigate a website or app regardless of their input device (mouse, keyboard, touchscreen, screen reader, etc).Ensure that all content is keyboard accessibleIn general, if a website can be operated using only the keyboard, it will also be operable with less-common input devices.  All controls must be addressable by the keyboard. By default, this includes &lt;a&gt;, &lt;area&gt;, &lt;object&gt;, and all form elements. Other elements can be made addressable by applying a tabindex value.  Avoid keyboard traps. If a user can tab to an element on the page, the user needs to be able to exit that element using only the keyboard as well.  Do not rely on specific timing of individual keystrokes when implementing keyboard accessibility.Give users ample time to interact with contentYou should not use time limits. For cases in which time limits are unavoidable:  Allow users to turn off or extend the time limit to at least 10 times the default setting.  Warn users at least 20 seconds before a time limit expires and enable a time extension with a simple action, such as pressing the space bar.  If a user needs to log in again after a time limit, make sure that there is no loss of data.Avoid interrupting users  Avoid popups or other modal dialogs that haven not been prompted by explicit user action or are alerting the user about something that is time-sensitive.  Allow users to pause, stop, or hide anything moving, blinking, or scrolling on the screen if the motion lasts longer than 5 seconds.  Allow users to pause, stop, hide, or control the frequency of auto-updating information.Do not create designs or interactions that may cause seizuresNothing on the page should flash more than 3 times in 1 second.Help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are  Allow users to bypass blocks of content that appear repeatedly on a website, like navigation, with a “skip to main content” or similar link.  Use titles that describe a webpage’s topic or purpose.  Include descriptive section headings to organize content.  Unless content is a step in a process, provide more than one way to access it, such as through browsing and search.  Provide a breadcrumb trail or other way for the user to identify their location in the site on every page.  Use descriptive link text. Avoid calls to action like “click here” or “read more.”Manage focusWhen users navigate a webpage using the keyboard or another alternative input device, only one element on the page will be in focus at a given time.  If the order of controls on a page matters, make sure they will be focused in that order when navigating by keyboard.  Make sure there is a visible indicator on screen of which element has focus. This may be an optional mode, but it should be turned on if the user begins to navigate with the keyboard.  If a user action causes a modal dialog to appear on screen, make sure the focus is moved to that dialog or area. When the dialog is dismissed, re-focus back to the original control or to some other logical place in the document.Understandable(view on W3C site)Users must be able to comprehend content and how to operate an interface.Create text content that is machine- and human-readable  Specify the language of the content in a machine-readable way. Generally, this means using &lt;html lang=\"en-us\"&gt; or the equivalent for another language. This will help with translation software and ensures that screen readers will use the correct pronunciation.  If part of a document is in a different language from the overall language of the document, specify this with something like &lt;span lang=\"fr\"&gt;.  Where possible, provide a way for users to find definitions of unusual words and phrases, especially jargon.  Make the meaning of abbreviations and acronyms available, either directly in the text, such as “Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)”, or in a machine-readable way, like &lt;abbr title=\"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\"&gt;CFPB&lt;/abbr&gt;).  Write text to an eighth-grade comprehension level, excluding proper names and titles, where possible. If that is not an option, provide a simplified version of the text nearby.  For hard-to-pronounce words, consider including the pronunciation.Develop sites that behave in a predictable way  Related webpages should have a consistent navigation structure and layout.  Components that perform the same action should be labelled the same way.Maintain contextAvoid changing a user’s context without an explicit request from the user, like clicking a button. If an automatic context change is necessary, warn the user in advance, and give them an opportunity to stop it.A few examples of context changes:  Submitting a form  Moving focus to a different element  Popping open a help dialog box  Launching a new window  Following a link  Reloading most of the content on a pageRobust(View on W3C site)Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. A robust site will be broadly compatible with past, current, and future web browsers and devices.Follow standard web best practicesThis means using standard HTML markup. If complex widgets are required, use WAI-ARIA to make the use, states, and properties clear to browsers and assistive technologies.  Make sure your HTML validates.  Use unique IDs on individual pages.  Avoid deprecated or proprietary markup.  Make sure states and properties of elements are machine readable.Note that this is specific to HTML and does not include CSS.",

Stylistic guidelines  Base shapes  Beam patterns are created using trapezoids and parallelograms that feature the 9° angle.    Color  Beam patterns include all three CFPB Green tones. Using transparency increases the strength of the beam metaphor. Transparency should be achieved through opacity, not blending modes like multiply / darken / etc.  Composition Beam patterns are composed of overlapping beams that frame areas of white space used for titles, text, and other graphic elements. Beams always point horizontally, not vertically.  Ideal composition  Solid green beam bleeds off the top of the layout. Beams alternate direction to create layered beam shapes.    Ideal composition  Layered beams anchor to the bottom, leaving plenty of white space above for type. This works especially well for horizontal layouts.    {% include icons/error-round.svg %} Poor composition  Beams float in white space, leaving little room for content. No transparency used.    {% include icons/error-round.svg %} Poor composition  All three beams layer in the same direction, weakening the beam metaphor.  ",

The label of the parent checkbox should be clickable.  Clicking on the label or arrow toggles the opening/closing of the child options.  In open state, arrow points up; in closed state, arrow points down.  Child options are in black text and not clickable.  Clicking on the parent checkbox selects the parent option and all child options.

About 1 in 12 men with Northern European ancestry have green/red color blindness.Instead of green/red, the teal/red color combination should used instead for pro/con, yes/no, positive/negative relationships. This both improves accessibility associated with color blindness, and also leaves the CFPB green color to represent the brand.This is an example of a visualization using the green/red combination, and how it can appear to someone with red/green color blindness:This is an example of a visualization using the teal/red combination, and how it can appear to someone with red/green color blindness:  Do not use color as the only means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.  Text should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5 : 1, but there are exceptions.          For large text, a contrast ratio of only 3 : 1 is necessary. Large regular text is at least 18pt/24px, while large bold text is 14pt/18px.      Text or images of text that are either pure decoration or not visible, or are part of a logo, picture that contains significant other visual content, or inactive UI components (like disabled form controls) do not have a color contrast requirement.

            'title': 'Contributing to the code base',
            'description': "There are two primary ways to help: using the issue tracker, and changing the codebase.Note:  All contributions to this project will be released under the CC0 public domain dedication. By submitting a pull request or filing a bug, issue, or feature request, you are agreeing to comply with this waiver of copyright interest. Details can be found in our TERMS and LICENSE.Using the issue trackerUse the issue tracker to suggest feature requests, report bugs, and ask questions—or use it to find ways to contribute, by finding a bug or a feature. If you[ll contribute, make a comment in the issue, then follow the Changing the codebase guidance below.Changing the codebaseWe work off feature branches from the master branch. After you’ve edited a component, open a Pull Request to merge your feature branch back into master.Sample workflowFor example, if you wanted to change @cfpb/cfpb-buttons and use it in cfgov-refresh, here’s what you’d do:  git clone git@github.com:cfpb/design-system.git, if you haven’t already.  cd design-system  git checkout master &amp;&amp; git pull to ensure you’re on the latest changes (this step is not necessary when cloning for the first time).  yarn to install dependencies and set up workspaces  git checkout -b button-fix to create a new branch for your changes.  Edit file(s) in /packages/buttons/ however you want.  yarn run design-system-link to link your local CF components.  cd ~/wherever/cfgov-refresh/ to navigate to another project where you’d like to test your buttons changes (in this case, cfgov-refresh).  yarn link @cfpb/cfpb-buttons to link @cfpb/cfpb-buttons to cfgov-refresh.  gulp build in cfgov-refresh to compile your stylesheets.  Start cfgov-refresh and navigate to a page with buttons to view your @cfpb/cfpb-buttons changes.  When you’re pleased with your changes, cd back to your design-system repo and commit your changes: git commit -am \"Fix button border radius\"  git push origin button-fix to push your branch up to GitHub.  Go to https://github.com/cfpb/design-system and open a pull request to merge button-fix into master.First-time contributor?If you are not a current contributor to this repository, use forks by first clicking the fork button on top of the repository and cloning your fork in step 1. In the final step, go to https://github.com/cfpb/design-system and file a pull request by clicking the link to compare changes across forks.Updating DocumentationThe Design System’s website lives in this repository’s docs/ directory and is powered by Netlify CMS and Jekyll. To edit any page of the website, click the edit button at the bottom right of the page. You’ll need to be added as a contributor to this repository in order to authenticate with Netlify CMS.Testing components locallyAutomated testsAutomated tests can be run with the command yarn test.Browser supportWe configure Autoprefixer and Babel to support the last 2 versions of the following browsers:  Chrome  Firefox  Safari  Internet Explorer                  Internet Explorer 9http://browserl.ist/?q=last+2+versions%2C+Explorer+%3E%3D+9                    Additional Autoprefixer support for Internet Explorer 8http://browserl.ist/?q=last+2+versions%2C+Explorer+%3E%3D+8What this means is that we add backwards compatibility for modern features where possible, and otherwise fall back to standard practices for that browser. For example, we don’t deliver interactive scripting for Internet Explorer 8, but we do ensure that default browser features continue to work so users can access the site and its contents.              Edge  Opera  iOS Safari  Opera Mini  Android Browser  BlackBerry Browser  Opera Mobile  Chrome for Android  Firefox for Android  Samsung InternetBrowser TestingFor automated testing, we use a headless version of Chrome to ensure the majority of the site is working as expected.For manual testing, we test locally or in a virtual environment with the following browsers: Chrome; Firefox; Safari; Internet Explorer 8, 9, 10, and 11; Edge; iOS Safari; and Chrome for Android.AutoprefixerAutoprefixer parses our CSS and adds vendor prefixes to rules where necessary using reported feature support by Can I Use. For more information visit the Autoprefixer documentation site.  #### Babel  Babel compiles our ES6 JavaScript where necessary for the browsers that either don’t support or have limited support of ES6 features. For more information visit the Babel documentation site.  #### Known feature differences  JavaScript: We do not serve interactive scripting to IE 8 but we do deliveranalytics via JavaScript.  Icons: We currently use icon fonts to deliver scalable icons. Browsers thatdo not support icon fonts unfortunately do not receive backups but we try toalways pair icons with text.Resources  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/  https://saucelabs.com/beta/dashboard/tests  http://developer.samsung.com/remotetestlab/rtlDeviceList.action#Release managementReady to publish changes to npm?  Ensure you’re on master and git pull to confirm you’re up-to-date.  Export a personal access token calledGITHUB_AUTH.  Run yarn run changelog and open CHANGELOG.md to see a previewof new changelog entries.We use a tool that scans ourPull Requests for specific labels so if you see a PR missing from the changelog,ensure it has been labeled breaking, enhancement, bug,documentation or internal.  If you’re pleased with the changelog preview,git checkout CHANGELOG.md to reset it.  Run yarn run release to start the release.  If all packages are shown as having been published,run git push to push changes to the remote master branch.Lerna will update the changelog, ask for a new version number, create a git tag, push to GitHub and publish to npm.NotesThe CSS and JavaScript files that are generated during the build task are only used for testing. Because this project doesn’t necessarily produce a final product it is up to the projects that use it to generate and maintain their own browser support config. An example of this is consumerfinance.gov, which generates specific IE 8 and 9 stylesheets, whereas the Design System build task bundles those with the main stylesheet. Despite the differences in delivery, the output and support are the same.Adhere to any linting errors or warningsThe gulp lint linting tasks that are set up within the build processes are there to promote consistency. When contributing code please publicly track that there are no linting errors or warnings using the testing checklist in the pull request description.Follow our CSS naming conventionsWe are using a customized BEM format.block-name .block-name_element-name .block-name__block-modifier .block-name_element-name__element-modifierAvoid creating elements of modifiersAppending an element name to a modifier class can result in a confusing class name like .list__space_item. Avoid this in favor of using a descendant, like this: .list__spaced .list_item.Shoot for mobile first declarationsIn most cases styles should be declared mobile first, then enhanced with min-width media queries. By doing this we create a base experience that all devices can use and one that does not require media query support.",

The list options are familiar to the user. A dropdown is not a good place to introduce new or complicated terms or concepts. For instance, if the question is “What’s your favorite color of the rainbow,” a dropdown could be a good choice. The options are familiar and there are more than six.

They can appear on their own or in groups.They can be used for displaying non-essential information on a page. They are also helpful for FAQ sections, schedules, and for conserving vertical space by collapsing secondary information on mobile devices.Information about Expandables can be found at:  http://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/page-components/expandables.html  https://cfpb.github.io/capital-framework/components/cf-expandables/",

            'content_guidelines': "IndividualWhen only one expandable is used, it should include a stroke on all sides, heading text, and the expand/collapse minicon within a circle with a label reading “Show” or “Hide” (when possible). A white or 5% gray background can be used to highlight the section from the page background.The entire bar is actionable. The header should clearly indicate what the user will see when the content is expanded (it should not be a call to action). Expand icons stay aligned at the top of the row when the title breaks to multiple lines.GroupWhen expandable sections are used in a group, they are stacked vertically, with each row sharing its top or bottom stroke with the adjacent row. In this use case, expandables have no background color of their own, but match whatever color they are used on (this would typically be a white page or 5% gray well). Title text should be consistent across a group of expandables.BehaviorCollapsedThe default collapsed state should include the expand/collapse minicon within a circle and a label (if space allows). The Show/Hide label can be hidden at narrower screen widths to prevent titles prematurely breaking onto multiple lines and to reduced visual clutter.ExpandedThe content of an expandable can contain normal paragraphs, headings, lists, wells, and images.Expandables can make use of an optional stroke under the title when expanded. The title stroke can help to define the title from the expanded content for longer sections of text. It should be indented left and right to match the text within the expandable section.In the default mode, users are able to have multiple sections of an expandable group expanded at the same time, which allows users to easily compare information that is available in different sections.CodeBelow are modifiers and elements of expandables.NOTE: If you use cf-expandables.less directly, be sure to run the file through Autoprefixer, or your compiled Capital Framework CSS will not work perfectly in older browsers.Expanded modifierSometimes you may want the expandable to be open by default. This is as easy as adding the .o-expandable_content__onload-open modifier to the .o-expandable_content block..o-expandable_content__onload-openPadded modifierAdds padding and a background color to .o-expandable_header and .o-expandable_content.In addition to using the .o-expandable__padded modifier you also need to make sure you are using .o-expandable_header..o-expandable__paddedSpaced headerAllows you to add space between .o-expandable_header and .o-expandable_content..o-expandable_header__spacedLabelAllows you to add some styled text.&lt;span class=\"o-expandable_label\"&gt;    Lorem ipsum&lt;/span&gt;LinkAllows you to add some styled text to look like a link.Note: only use this in the expandable header&lt;span class=\"o-expandable_link\"&gt;    Lorem ipsum&lt;/span&gt;HeaderCreates a full-width container to house information that is always visible. This is useful for more complicated expandables that need to convey more information than just ‘Show/Hide’ before the user expands it.Combine .o-expandable_header with .o-expandable_target for a full-width trigger..o-expandable_headerHeader left/rightAllows you to float information left and right..o-expandable_header-left.o-expandable_header-rightJavaScript APIA new array of Expandable instances can be created with const expandables = Expandable.init();.

Because this content is being featured temporarily, and not meant to be permanent, it shouldn’t be seen as integral to the page, meaning the content could be changed or removed from the page without taking away vital information the user needs or interrupting the user journey. Therefore, this module is not intended to support the site IA as the primary, permanent location for content.FCMs appear below the title and introductory paragraph on a page, and retain that position on all screen sizes. FCMs can appear on any page type, though they are best suited for pages third level and below in the site map. They are designed to accommodate pages with either a left-hand navigation or right-hand sidebar.",
            'use_cases': "Use a featured content module (FCM) when you want to highlight something that’s:      Timely: Highlights a new tool or development. Keep in mind: When you remove dated content from a FCM, make sure you’re not getting rid of the only way users can navigate to it. Make sure to plan a permanent home for the content.        Impactful: Lets people know immediately how the content will affect them, how they can use it, and how it might enhance their understanding of—or experience with—the primary page content.        Localized: New content that specifically applies to people in a specific geographic area; it may be important for that audience to see their specific content first, and when it’s removed from the page it won’t disrupt the usual user flow.        Unique: Content that is specifically in the Bureau’s “wheelhouse” because of our position as an approachable, trusted, unbiased authority.  Featured content modules should highlight a single piece of content. That content can be almost anything, from a webpage to a blog post to a PDF to a video.FCMs appear below the title and introductory paragraph on a page, and retain that position on all screen sizes.FCMs contain a headline, body copy text, a call to action (either a text link or a play button), and a graphical element related to the piece of content being featured.

When there’s no link or video for the user to interact with. If you just want to visually differentiate your content from its surroundings, consider using a well or inline text instead.  ",
            'content_guidelines': "FCMs contain a headline, descriptive body copy text, an optional call-to-action link, and a graphical element related to the piece of content being featured. They are a “mini story” and never simply a dominant visual.      Headings should be as succinct as possible and 35 characters or less (including spaces).        Descriptions should be action-oriented and let the user know what they will get out of the featured content and how it’s related to the main page content, not just what it is. Descriptions should be 160 characters or less (including spaces).        Links serve as a call-to-action, so they should begin with an action verb like “explore,” “read,” “learn,” or “discover.” When using an action verb, be specific and tie the action back to the content and what the user will get from it. As a best practice, only include up to one link in a FCM. Link text should be 35 characters or less (including spaces).        Do not include a link with a video FCM. In a FCM that features video, the desired action is for the user to play the video, so the play button serves as a visual call-to-action. This makes it especially important for the description in the FCM to be action-oriented. Encourage users to take the action of watching the video, and relate directly back to the video content and what they’ll get out of it.  Text is full-width and displayed above the visual in the default/mobile view. When creating a static image for the visual, it should be 1076px × 606px (a 16:9 aspect ratio), which is 2x the rendered width at the maximum size at which the visual will be seen (on a 600px wide display).",
            'behavior': "At desktop size, the ratio of text and visual changes with screen size to keep the full height of the image visible. As available width dips below the maximum page width, the text area shrinks in width while the visual maintains a fixed width of 270px. That means that the height and aspect ratio of the visual will change as the screen shrinks, and the image will be cropped between 16% and 29% from each side.At larger screen sizes, the image moves to the right of the text, occupying a fixed width of 270px (equal to 3 of 12 columns at max page width). By default, the left edge of the image is anchored to the left side of the visual’s 270px-wide area, and the right side is cropped off. The aspect ratio of the visual area increases as screen size increases, resulting in slightly different image cropping at different screen sizes, but the left edge of the image remains anchored in view. The full height of the image is always in view; the top and bottom are never cropped. See below for modifiers that change the image’s horizontal anchoring.",

            'title': 'Forms',
            'description': "Web forms provide an incredible advantage over paper forms in their potential for accessibility, usability, and operational efficiency, but when designed without users in mind, they can lose many of these benefits. In this guide, we’ve outlined several ways to ensure the best possible user experience.This page is under active development. Information is being moved into it from this page:  http://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/page-components/form-fields.htmlChoosing a form structureThe structure of your form should fit with the ways in which your users will want to use it.Ask yourself:  Will your users want to move through the form in a fixed order, or one of their choosing?  Will they be able to complete the form in a single go?  Will their answers affect other parts of the form?  Will they want to go back and review or change answers to previous questions?  Will they need to add or remove items from a list, or change the order of things?  How many parties are involved in the form?  Do any parts of the form take place offline?  At what point is the form regarded as complete?How you answer these questions will help you decide how to structure the form. It can help to think in terms of levels: sections, subsections, groups, etc. Try not to worry about how those levels should be represented in the interface until you have a broader understanding of the overall structure.For example, on a website, you might choose to have one section per page, or multiple sections per page. It depends on what’s going to work best for your users.Example structuresOption 1: Single pageAll sections are positioned on a single page.The good  There’s only one submit button to press  A single URL gives access to all form fields  It doesn’t force a fixed order of completion  You benefit from context of neighboring sections  Progress is self-evidentThe bad  Long forms can be overwhelming and off-putting  It’s less well suited to branching or non-linear flow  How do you save partial progress?  Can be harder to track analytics like drop-off ratesOption 2: WizardEach section goes on its own page.The good  It’s easier to handle branching and dependencies between sections  It’s easier to let the user save progress  A long form can feel more manageable  Easier to guide a user through an unfamiliar process  Easier to capture analytics like drop-off rates for each sectionThe bad  Can be harder for users to see where they are within the form  It can slow users down as they have to click and load each section  You lose the contextual information from neighboring sections  Harder for users to review and edit previous sections  There’s no single place for users to go back and edit their data  Not a natural fit for non-linear processes like looping, adding and removingOption 3: Accordion formAll sections on a single page, but each new section only appears once the previous section has been completed. Done well, option 3 is a hybrid of the other two that has benefits of both the other options.Within this hybrid option there are still some important design decisions to make, for example:  Will future questions be shown in any way or will you only see the questions you’ve answered?  What happens if you go back and edit a previous question?  Does the current question stay open or closed?  How do you get back to the current question once you’ve edited a previous one?  Do you lose all your answers to questions that follow the one you go back to edit?The good  Can handle branching and dependencies between sections  Can easily review and edit previous questions  Can help guide a user through an unfamiliar process  User still benefits from some surrounding context  Progress is clearThe bad  Implementation and interface is more complexOption 4: HybridFor more complicated forms, some combination of the other options might be your best bet. Done well, this can give you the benefits of both the single page and wizard approaches. It also allows you to create a sense of rhythm to the overall flow, which can help users understand when they have moved into a different part of the form, and break up the monotony of filling in forms.As always, these design decisions must have a strong, user-centred rationale behind them.Helping usersYou should be aiming for a service that’s so intuitive people don’t need any help in using it. If you find yourself explaining the interface within the interface it’s a sign that something has gone wrong.Sometimes though, people are going to need extra help. Many government forms involve concepts and terminology that people will be unfamiliar with. Some of this stuff takes a lot of explaining, so we need a way of providing contextual help of varying degrees of detail throughout a form.Methods for providing extra help:INLINE HELPShort, snappy text, positioned near the part of the interface it refers to. If it’s something that everyone needs to know, make it permanently visible.PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSUREA fancy phrase for hiding stuff until it’s clicked on. Used carefully this is a good way of keeping the interface free from potentially confusing clutter. Only use this for help that’s intended for a small subset of your audience (say, less than 10%).FIELD MASKINGWhen a specific data entry format is required, as for phone numbers, dates, and social security numbers, provide an example of the required format (e.g., XXX-XX-XXXX).RICH CONTEXTUAL HELPSometimes you need to give users access to supporting content, in case they’re unfamiliar with the terminology or concepts involved in the form. This kind of content should probably exist as a page outside of the form, and then be repurposed in some way within the form.Communicating errorsDespite providing the best possible helper text and contextual help, you should still plan for when users make errors when filling out your forms.Tips for communicating errors:INDICATE OPTIONAL AND/OR REQUIRED FIELDSIf most of the fields are required, leave them alone and just mark the optional fields as optional. If most of the fields are optional, leave them alone and just mark the required fields as required. If it’s close to a tie, go with whichever choice might be better for your users.COMBINE FIELD-LEVEL ERROR TEXT WITH A PAGE-LEVEL ERROR MESSAGEThis is particularly important for accessibility. If someone is using a screenreader to navigate the page, a digest of errors at the top of the page will help them understand which fields need fixing. Including anchor links to the invalid fields will allow them to find and fix the error without re-navigating the entire form.BE DESCRIPTIVE WITH ERROR TEXTTell the user what caused the error and how to correct it.VALIDATE FIELDS BEFORE THE USER SUBMITSCheck for errors as the user fills out the form (e.g., using javascript) and provide inline messaging with instructions for how to correct the error.Also consider including affirmative inline validation (such as green checkmarks) for required text fields, especially those that require specific formats or character counts, such as Zip Codes and passwords.Saving progressIf the average time to complete a form is more than you can reasonably expect your users to spend in a single session, then you need to provide a way for them to save their progress.The same goes if the session is likely to be interrupted for some reason. For example, if the user is suddenly asked for information which they might not have immediately on hand (a way to mitigate this is to warn users if they’re going to be asked for that kind of information). Another example is that the user might start a form on their mobile device and want to continue filling it out on their desktop computer.Setting expectationsThe further in to a form someone gets, the more time they have invested in it and the greater their annoyance if they have to abandon it for some reason.Be honest about what you’re offering users, and what you’re not offering them. In particular, people need to know up front about any:  Costs involved  Waiting periods or delays  Uncommon or hard-to-find infomation they’ll need to provide  Constraints on who can complete the form (age, nationality, etc)  Equipment that will be required (e.g., a printer)  Non-digital parts of the formUse common sense, though. Don’t try to make everyone read a page of terms and conditions before they start (they won’t).The best approach is to meet (or exceed) people’s expectations. For example, if your delivery times are typical and you accept all the usual payment methods then you won’t need to warn everyone about them up front.Keeping it simpleEvery request for information from the user:  Requires additional physical and cognitive effort  Creates another opportunity for them to get something ‘wrong’  Increases the time it takes to complete the form  Increases the perception that the service is invasive  Increases the risk that users will give up or fail to submit your formAsking for information because ‘it might be useful’ or ‘it helps with our record keeping’ should be considered against all of these factors.AttributionThis guide on effective forms has been adapted from the guide Designing transactions in the GOV.UK Government Service Design Manual, which is licensed under the Open Government License v2.0.",

Nor does it document how to use said grid system. This page probably needs a major re-write.The grid component is a suite of Less variable and mixins that enables you tolay out a flexible 12-column grid with fixed-size gutters.(Column widths will expand and contract with the width of the page,but the gutter width remains constant.)The mixins are made to be used within your project’s Less code to give gridlayout to your content without needing to use non-semantic grid classes.For example, when creating a half-and-half layout, instead of applying classesto your column wrappers, like this:&lt;div class=\"col-half\"&gt; … &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=\"col-half\"&gt; … &lt;/div&gt;You can give your wrappers semantic class names that describe their content,and apply the mixins to those semantic classes, like this:&lt;div class=\"description\"&gt; … &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=\"illustration\"&gt; … &lt;/div&gt;.description,.illustration {    .grid_column(1, 2);}Read on for more details on the variables and mixins this component provides.

            'behavior': "In certain instances, icons can be animated to aid communication or to reassure the user that an action is functioning as intended. Examples include saving or loading content. Depending on the context, the animated icon follows the standards of the component that contains it, for example, the icon follows the size and padding standards for buttons when placed inside a button to indicate loading or follows standards of a form-level alert within an alert message.Our previous font icon system provided modifiers to rotate any icon. We found in reality this wasn’t practical and only one icon is ever animated, update. We’ve provided an alias–updating–to be used within the UI when a user needs to be made aware that the website is working on responding to their actions.DownloadIcon fontOur full icon set is available for desktop use as an icon font (.ttf). It can be accessed through programs like Illustrator and InDesign via the glyph panel.Vector filesEach of our icons is available for download as a vector (.svg) on The Noun Project, a platform that collects and catalogs icons that are created and uploaded by graphic designers from around the world.View on Noun ProjectSVG icon basicsThe cf-icon component provides Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) icons for Capital Framework. This component can be used by itself, but is designed to work with Capital Framework.We subscribe to the guidance offered by Chris Coyier in his article, “A Pretty Good SVG Icon System”, in which he concludes, “Just include the icons inline.”Because including raw SVG code is not necessarily pretty or user-friendly, we encourage using your templating system to include them by reference.  Note: Jinja2, the templating language that cfgov-refresh uses, has a near-identical syntax for includes, but it requires that the path be enclosed in quotation marks, like so: {% include 'icons/download.svg' %}.The filenames of the SVGs included with cf-icons match the names in the Icon library section. There are duplicate SVG files for each alias, as well.  Note to contributors: If any icon is ever updated, you must be sure to also update each of the alias SVGs.What the Less is doingIf you look in cf-icons.less, below the aforementioned sizing variable, you’ll see this simple rule:.cf-icon-svg {    height: @cf-icon-height;    vertical-align: text-top;    fill: currentColor;    …}Referring back to the example above, you can see that we have encoded class=\"cf-icon-svg\" in the root element of each of our SVG icons. As a result, the Less rule gets applied to all of the SVGs on the page, just like any other HTML element.We start by limiting the size of the SVG to a proportion of the text height, using the @cf-icon-height variable’s em value. To align the canvas of the icon with the canvas of neighboring text, we set vertical-align: text-top;. Finally, setting fill: currentColor; tells the SVG to set its path’s fill color to match the color value of its parent element.CaveatsThere are two modifications based on restrictions in Internet Explorer 8 and 9 (IE8/IE9).First, IE8 does not support fill: currentColor. Typically the fallback would be to use a PNG image, but due to the inability to know what the background or text color of its surroundings are, we found it better to fall back to the paired text with no icon.Second, IE9 displays SVGs as full width by default (not the paths, just the SVG container). To eliminate this issue we’ve set the width of the SVGs to match the height. The whitespace to the left or right may not be quite accurate, but we determined this is an acceptable difference for a legacy browser like IE9.Inline SVG backgroundIn some cases we embed an SVG as a background image. To accomplish this, a custom less plugin is used to inject the SVG icon source file inline into the CSS background-image property. This is exposed via a mixin, .u-svg-inline-bg( @name ), where @name is the SVG icon canonical name.",

Illustrations should appear natural, but stylized. Do not scale-up or collage minicons or isocons for use in illustrations. Minicons can be used as graphic details when scaled appropriately.Illustrations should be compositionally balanced with related headers and text. Reduce “floating” by bleeding illustrations off the edges of the graphic. Make use of layering and subtle, vector-based background patterns to help ground the illustration. Shadows are appropriate when objects overlap but should not extend outside of objects.Do not use negative space to define outlines.FormAll illustrations should be based on commonly used geometric shapes like circles, triangles, beams, and rectangles.To stylize illustrations according to CFPB standards, use relative sizing on stroke weights with a rounded end cap. For curved lines, the stylized stroke is recommended throughout illustrations.Shading and highlightsObjects should be lit from the upper-left side. This is consistent with the beam in our logo. The overall placement of highlights and shading should be carefully decided by the designer and consistent throughout the project.Shading should be achieved using subtle, solid tints, not gradients, textures, multiply, or blurs.There are two types of highlights available for illustrations; curved and diagonal. The curved highlight is recommended when the object is round. Diagonal highlights are mostly used in rectangular objects. They are also frequently used to show reflections. To create a diagonal highlight, a tint of the background color is cast from the top-right corner of an object at a 45º angle.ShadowsShadows are created using a darker tint of the background color. They are appropriate when objects overlap but should not extend outside of objects. In top-facing illustrations, shadows around objects can be used to create realism.The overall placement of shadows should be carefully decided by the designer and consistent throughout the project.",

            'title': 'Integrating the Design System into your project',
            'description': "The Design System provides a set of modular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript patterns that can be used both collectively and individually. There are several ways to integrate it into your project:  Installing a single component with npm or yarn  Using the generator  Using Less  Downloading the compiled CSSOur recommended workflow if you are starting a new codebase is to use the generator to scaffold out a new Design System project. This allows you to pick and choose your modules as well as providing a solid front end build process.Installing a single component with npm or yarnJust want one or two CF components and not the entire framework?Simply install and @import only the components you need.Install with yarn or npmPick one:yarn add cf-buttons cf-iconsornpm install cf-buttons cf-iconsImport CSS@import (less) \"node_modules/@cfpb/cfpb-buttons/src/cfpb-buttons.less\";@import (less) \"node_modules/@cfpb/cfpb-icons/src/cfpb-icons.less\";/* the rest of your stylesheet… */  NOTE: Be sure to run the Less files through  Autoprefixer,  or your compiled CSS might not work perfectly in older browsers.Import JavaScriptimport Expandable from '@cfpb/cfpb-expandables/src/Expandable'';Expandable.init( document.querySelector( '#container' ) );Using the generatorTo use the generator, you will need Node.js,Yeoman, and Gulp.Installing dependenciesNode.js can be downloaded and installed directly from the Node website, or by using a package manager for your system. At the CFPB we use Homebrew. To install the dependencies:brew install node  # if installing node with Homebrewnpm install --global gulp yo generator-cfScaffolding out a projectTo create a new project, create a directory, cd into that directory, and run the yo cf command:mkdir my-awesome-projectcd my-awesome-projectyo cfThe generator will prompt you to complete information about the project and choose the Design System modules you would like to use.Navigating the project folderOnce the generator has finished you’ll have a folder full of files and folders.Here’s a quick guide on working with these files:  Run npm run build to process the files in src and output them to dist.  To view your site, go to the dist directory and start a local server: cd dist &amp;&amp; python -m SimpleHTTPServer. You can now navigate to localhost:8000 in your web browser.  Edit files within the src directory and re-run npm run build to view changes.Editing the Less and JSThe generator has created a starter Less file at src/static/css/main.less.This file includes all of the necessary imports needed for Capital Framework.There is also a starter JavaScript file at src/static/js/main.js.Both main.less and main.js are already wired into Gruntfile.js (or gulp/tasks/if you selected gulp) so compiling is as easy as running npm run build. It alsocopies files from src into dist, which will update what you see at localhost:8000/.Theming / CustomizingYou can override component UI colors within src/static/css/cf-theme-overrides.less.This is already set up for you and gets imported by main.less.If you would like to use your own color palette simply replace the contents ofbrand-palette.less with your own color variables,then update cf-theme-overrides.less by overriding each UI color variablewith a color from brand-palette.less or any color of your choosing.The same applies when you need to add custom styles to your project.You can add any custom .less files to your project that you may need,just remember to import them in main.less using the correct path.Using LessIf you don’t want to use the generator,you can just download the source files and import them into your project.  NOTE: Be sure to run the Less files through  Autoprefixer,  or your compiled CSS will  not work perfectly in older browsers.Run npm install capital-framework. This will download Capital Framework to yourproject’s node_modules directory. You can then import the framework intoyour application’s primary Less file:@import (less) \"node_modules/capital-framework/src/capital-framework.less\";/* the rest of your stylesheet… */Just want one or two CF components and not the entire framework?Simply install and @import only the components you need.npm install cf-buttons cf-icons@import (less) \"node_modules/cf-buttons/src/cfpb-buttons.less\";@import (less) \"node_modules/cf-icons/src/cfpb-icons.less\";/* the rest of your stylesheet… */Downloading the compiled CSSCapital Framework’s compiled CSS can be downloaded here.Download it and copy the files found in the dist/ directory to your project.Use standard &lt;link&gt; and &lt;script&gt; tags.&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;    &lt;title&gt;My Awesome Project&lt;/title&gt;    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"capital-framework.min.css\"&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;    &lt;!-- Your project's HTML goes here. --&gt;    &lt;script src=\"capital-framework.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;",

            'description': "  The CFPB logo was designed to symbolize vigilance, transparency, and a consumer focus. Consumers are the foundation and focus of our mission and our logo reflects that. A soft beam of light symbolizes our efforts to illuminate the financial landscape and foster transparency in the marketplace.  Lockups  Horizontal  The horizontal lockup is the primary option and appears on our stationery and website.    Vertical  The vertical lockup is useful for square frames or narrow columns.    Isolated  The isolated logo is primarily used for internal-facing communications. For all external communications, the logo needs to be in a lockup with “Consumer Financial Protection Bureau” to ensure clear communication.    Small execution  The small execution lockup is used when the logo needs to scale down to less than 0.75” or 54 pixels at 72 dpi. The small execution logo allows “Consumer Financial Protection Bureau” to remain legible.  Variations  Spanish logo  The Spanish logo should be used for Spanish language materials, such as websites and microsites, publications, and signage.  This is applicable for the horizontal, vertical, and small execution lockups.    One color logo  When the logo is being produced for print formats conditions may not allow for full color. For these rare cases, the one-color logo may be used only in black on a white background.This is applicable for the horizontal, vertical, isolated, and small execution lockups.  Stylistic guidelines  Clear space  There should always be ample space around the logo to ensure maximum impact and keep the mark from looking cluttered.

These are our benchmark sizes for 8.5 x 11” documents, including reports, brochures, powerpoints, and forms. For large-format print pieces, such as posters and banners, where the logo is used with a height greater than 1”, it should be used in increments of 1/2”.      8.5 x 11” documents              Lockup: horizontal      Height: 0.5”      Clear space: 0.25”            8.5 x 11” documents              Lockup: vertical      Height: 0.77”      Clear space: 0.25”        Complex backgrounds  The logo should be shown on a white background for optimal appearance.

It’s focused on navigation and content.  It’s a good and ever-improving experience.More detailed version of design principles  Our mega menu is based on industry standards around web development and user expectations around interactions. The mega menu works:  across our supported browsers,  across different browser sizes (and not just device form factors),  across the spectrum of user ability levels or technology familiarity, and  in line with the standard interactions for different assistive techniques.      Our mega menu is designed to be equitable and provides full navigational support to all users. This includes users with physical disabilities, hearing and visual impairments, mental disorders, cognitive disabilities, or seizure disorders. Our mega menu is accessible and usable by all who use assistive technologies regardless of what type of disability they might have or their percentage within our larger user base. We do not ignore the needs of the few to only focus on the many.        Our mega menu fully aligns with the WCAG core accessibility principles known as POUR: every part of it is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for all users.        Our mega menu is built mobile-first with semantic code to focus on the content and navigation elements within it. It’s designed to work with the interaction defaults of both JAWS and Apple VoiceOver. The visual design supports all of these factors and doesn’t supersede them.        We maintain a good mega menu experience for our users and actively work to improve it. All the designers and developers in the department read, share, and know where to find basic information about the mega menu. We are aware of its guidelines, its complexities, and what traps to avoid falling into when modifying it. We monitor and publish our site analytics for the mega menu on a regular basis to make sure that we’re continually aware of how users are using it and able to make necessary adjustments over time as needed. We also usability test the mega menu with external users as a part of the monitoring process.  The consumerfinance.gov website mega menu is composed of five verticals: Consumer Tools, Practitioner Resources, Data &amp; Research, Policy &amp; Compliance, and About Us. The visual layout, spacing, and some portion of the content guidelines will change in the near future, as we monitor analytics information.",
            'use_cases': "",
            'content_guidelines': "Maximum number of linksAnalytics review suggests that 7 links per column should be the maximum, assuming space on top of the menu for a section overview page.  Around 70% of desktop visitors to consumerfinance.gov have a screen height of 768 px or more. At that screen height, 7 is the maximum number of links that users see before items below are cut off, assuming 5 links around 20 characters or less with spaces, and 2 links up to 35-40 characters with spaces. This also assumes no extra browser chrome, such as an address or bookmark bar, and flush placement of browser window to top of screen.  Research also shows 7 is around the maximum number of items that one can scan and comfortably hold in short-term memory. The idea is to minimize cognitive load by grouping like items into categories that can be easily scanned and that line up with the user’s mental models.  For a vertical with two sections, one section can have 14 links maximum, the other section up to 7 links maximum, given space for a featured item, which occupies the fourth column. (There should be no more than three main sections in a vertical, but it’s easier for users to scan up to two.)  If a section of links spans two columns, the number of links should be evenly distributed between columns.Link character counts  Links should be 20 characters or less, including spaces.  Two exceptions per column can be made for longer links. These longer links can be 30-35 characters with spaces maximum (e.g. “Managing someone else’s money”).Editorial guidelines  Links should be in alphabetical order and written in title case  Ampersands (“&amp;”) should be used in place of the word “and”  See previous section for link limits and character count guidance  Links should generally be straightforward and self-explanatory, avoiding jargon or brand names that might be difficult for users to understand  Links should generally go to consumerfinance.gov pages only  Links should reflect page titles, but don’t necessarily have to duplicate them verbatim",

Due to their disruptive nature, modal windows should only be used in very specific cases outlined below.Feedback or correctionModals can be effective for communicating a warning or alert outside the main web page. They can be triggered by a user interaction (like pressing a button to “save”) or without an interaction (like a timeout warning after a period of inactivity).InterruptionUse modals to force the user to complete a task or make a decision that requires their full attention outside of the main workflow. A critical piece of this scenario is that you need the workflow to be interrupted to be effective. If not, explore other UI elements to accomplish the goal.Examples of when to use modals  Confirm an action that can’t be undone, such as “Are you sure you want to delete this?  Display a warning that something is about to expire or timeout  Save a form that requires inputs separate from the main workflow, like entering a “Save as” file name  Focus attention on the need to accept or acknowledge something before the user can proceed",

            'behavior': "Opening a modalModals can be triggered by links, buttons, or even inactivity on a site. When a modal opens, set the focus to the first element users need to interact with. This could be either the first form field in the modal window or the primary action button.Scrolling within a modalModal windows should not scroll. If a modal contains enough information to require scrolling, use an alternative method of displaying content, such as a different UI element or another content page.Closing a modalActions inside modals should be clearly marked. There should be a clear path forward (“continue”) and back (“cancel”), in addition to a clearly labeled way to close the modal without taking any action at all. When a modal window is closed, return focus to the last active element on the page behind the modal.Modal windows are always closable by clicking or tapping:  A delete minicon or label in the upper right corner  The next action button or link  Anywhere outside the modal window  ESC key on a keyboardCreating accessible behaviorsKeyboard access should be limited to only interacting with the modal dialog once it is visible.  The close minicon needs to be accessible from a keyboard.  The escape key should also close the modal.  The enter key should should be mapped to any submission forms in the modal.Provide separate focus and hover states for the close minicon and any “next” action buttons.The find function (ctrl+F) will not search information contained within a modal window.Include offscreen instructions that describe the modal dialog and how to interact with it.Specific development directions  Modal windows should be marked with aria-hidden=”true” and toggled to false when visible and given the role=dialog ARIA role.  When the modal dialog is displayed, the main content of the page should be marked with aria-hidden=”true” to prevent screen readers from interacting with it.  Add role=”alertdialog” to the modal window.  Code the close minicon using a button element for more semantic markup.  The heading of the modal dialog should use an H1 tag.  Offscreen interaction instructions should use aria-labelledby attribute.",

When the table loads, it should be sorted by one of the sortable columns by default and indicate which column is already sorted. Not every column of a table needs to be sortable.At large screen sizes, tables can be sorted using the header of any sortable column.  The currently sorted column is marked with an up or down triangle for ascending and descending sorts, respectively  On hover, the currently sorted column shows the opposite triangle  Columns that can sort show an up triangle on hover  Columns that cannot sort show nothing on hoverIf sorting is needed for smaller screens, use a filter-like expandable with a sorting control (or add a sorting control to the existing filter if the table has one) that only appears when the table switches from tabular to stacked.More information can be found at:  http://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/page-components/tables.html  https://cfpb.github.io/capital-framework/components/cf-tables/#sortable-tables",

To allow the table to be sorted by a column, add a button to the th of the column like so:…&lt;button class=\"sortable\"&gt;    Column Name&lt;/button&gt;…The use of a button helps address certain accessibility concerns.Sorting typeTo sort properly, the type of the data can be specified. By default, the column’s values will be sorted as string values. However, the column can be specifically sorted by number values (in which case, the cell’s contents are stripped of non-numeric characters, then sorted by the resulting number). To see an example, the sample table later in this document sorts the “Distance” column by number value.To sort by number value, add the data-sort_type=\"number\" attribute to the sorting button:&lt;table class=\"o-table o-table__sortable\"&gt;    …        &lt;th&gt;            &lt;button class=\"sortable\" data-sort_type=\"number\"&gt;Column Name&lt;/button&gt;        &lt;/th&gt;    …&lt;/table&gt;Sorting table on page loadTo sort the table on page load, use the .sorted-up and .sorted-down classes:&lt;table class=\"o-table o-table__sortable\"&gt;    …        &lt;th&gt;            &lt;button class=\"sortable sorted-up\"&gt;Column Name&lt;/button&gt;        &lt;/th&gt;    …&lt;/table&gt;  The class .sorted-up refers to a sort from smallest to greatest (first to last), and .sorted-down refers to a sort from greatest to smallest (last to first).

            'use_cases': "Tables are only one method for presenting many data points grouped together in a visual way. Other options include charts or graphs.Tables serve a unique purpose of allowing easy organization or comparison of more complex data than a chart or graph. They can be read either vertically (by columns) or horizontally (by rows).Tables work best when:  Presenting sequential data  Data being presented requires specific or precise values  Individual values are being presented or compared  Values across columns or rows require different units of measurement",
            'content_guidelines': "As a rule, design tables so that they are easy to read. Label columns precisely and include units of measurement where necessary. Organize the data so that the underlying meaning is quickly apparent.Labels and TitlesGive tables a meaningful title that succinctly describes the content presented so that users can understand their purpose at a glance. If presenting more than one table within a page, consider adding labels (e.g. “Table 1,” “Table 2,” etc.) in addition to titles. Labels should precede titles (e.g. “Table 1: The title given to this table”).Long column labelsConsider using fixed columns or truncation for column labels that are significantly longer than the expected width of the data.Unit of measurementMake sure to indicate the unit of measurement. In terms of placement, if the units are the same across columns, indicate the unit of measurement in the title or someplace noticeable above the table.Alternatively, if the table uses at most two units of measurement, consider using asterisks following the column label, and define the unit of measurement below the table, as shown in the example here.If units differ from column to column, the standard is to list the unit of measure in parentheses following the column label. Make sure to use common abbreviations when indicating units of measure. Spell out any ambiguous or obscure abbreviations.",
            'behavior': "Since the nature of tables relies so much on visual space, there are several common variations that can be used to accommodate different types of data in a table.Stacking tablesA default table would “stack” the information on a smaller screen, since shrinking a table that maintained its columns/row structure would make it illegible.Directory tablesWhen the data you’re presenting should only be read across the rows (instead of down columns), you can use a directory table. The first column in these tables is what organizes or labels the other data points in the row.For instance, contact information is comprised of a name, phone number, and email address. An event is made up of the name of the event, time, and location. You need all three pieces of data to create an understanding of the thing being shown, and the first column of data is the key to that understanding.The default stacking behavior on smaller breakpoints doesn’t maintain that “first column” importance since it stacks based on column headers.As such, at the small screen breakpoint, the directory table pattern uses that first column data (employee name, for instance) as a way to group and label stacks of rows.See guidance on styles for a a directory table and how it should look on smaller breakpoints.Scrolling tablesWhen the data you’re presenting has more columns than what will comfortably fit on the screen, you can use a table that scrolls horizontally. This becomes especially important when thinking about tables on smaller screens, instead of allowing the data to stack at smaller breakpoints.Using a table that scrolls ensures that all the information can be accessed in its original tabular structure, even on a smaller screen.See guidance on styles for a table that scrolls horizontally at all screen sizes.Sorting tablesAt large screen sizes, tables can be sorted using the header of any sortable column.  The currently sorted column is marked with an up or down triangle for ascending and descending sorts, respectively  On hover, the currently sorted column shows the opposite triangle  Columns that can sort show an up triangle on hover  Columns that cannot sort show nothing on hoverIf sorting is needed for smaller screens, use a filter-like expandable with a sorting control (or add a sorting control to the existing filter if the table has one) that only appears when the table switches from tabular to stacked.CodeMaking a table sortableBy adding the .o-table__sortable class to a table, the table becomes sortable. To allow the table to be sorted by a column, add a button to the th of the column like so:…&lt;button class=\"sortable\"&gt;    Column Name&lt;/button&gt;…The use of a button helps address certain accessibility concerns.Sorting typeTo sort properly, the type of the data can be specified. By default, the column’s values will be sorted as string values. However, the column can be specifically sorted by number values (in which case, the cell’s contents are stripped of non-numeric characters, then sorted by the resulting number). To see an example, the sample table later in this document sorts the “Distance” column by number value.To sort by number value, add the data-sort_type=\"number\" attribute to the sorting button:&lt;table class=\"o-table o-table__sortable\"&gt;    …        &lt;th&gt;            &lt;button class=\"sortable\" data-sort_type=\"number\"&gt;Column Name&lt;/button&gt;        &lt;/th&gt;    …&lt;/table&gt;Sorting table on page loadTo sort the table on page load, use the .sorted-up and .sorted-down classes:&lt;table class=\"o-table o-table__sortable\"&gt;    …        &lt;th&gt;            &lt;button class=\"sortable sorted-up\"&gt;Column Name&lt;/button&gt;        &lt;/th&gt;    …&lt;/table&gt;  The class .sorted-up refers to a sort from smallest to greatest (first to last), and .sorted-down refers to a sort from greatest to smallest (last to first). These classes are added to the th when sorting occurs.  Please note the importance of defining a thead and tbody to preserve the table’s header through sorting operations.",

Spacing between typographic elements should be open enough to feel light, but close enough to establish a proper relationship between elements.Heading followed by body copyWhen a heading is followed by paragraph text, include 30px of space below Display and 15px below Headings 1–6.Body copy followed by a headingWhen body copy is followed by a heading, include 45px of space above Heading 2 and 30px above Headings 3–6.Heading followed by a headingFor stacked headings, include 30 px of space after the primary heading.Body copy spacingFor multiple paragraphs within the same section set the space between paragraphs to 15px.",

For video-only content, provide an audio track or transcript that describes the video.  Combined audio and video content should accommodate alternatives for both (e.g., closed captioning or sign interpretation for audio, and an audio track or a screenplay-like document that transcribes dialog and descriptions of sounds and action for video).LIVE CONTENT  Closed captioning or sign language interpretation should always be available, but in some cases providing the prepared remarks or script alongside the audio/video may suffice.Make content easily distinguishable from its surroundingsThese guidelines help ensure that content is perceivable for sighted users.AUDIO  Avoid auto-playing audio. If this is absolutely unavoidable, provide a control that allows the user to stop the audio and adjust or mute the volume.  In recorded audio, background sounds should be at least 20 dB lower than foreground sounds and speech.
