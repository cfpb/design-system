  The filter control panel allows users to whittle down number of items in a
  list to help them focus in on a specific piece of content they may be looking
  for, or find content relevant to them based on specific filter parameters,
  housed in an expandable above the list.

  <h3>Use cases</h3>


  Use filters in conjunction with search to help users narrow down large amounts
  of data or content.


  #### When to use

  * When presenting more than 20 documents or listings together for users to
  browse through.

  * Users interacting with content will want to focus their searching activities
  on this specific group of content, rather than using the general site search.

  * Data has relevant characteristics to filter on, for example product and
  issue for complaint data, location and property type for HMDA, date range and
  categories for articles


  #### When other options are better

  * The total amount of content can be skimmed in a list of 20 items or less.

  * Characteristics available as filter options, such as topics, dates, and
  categories, are not relevant to the content.

  * Search alone is sufficient for user needs


  <h3>Content guidelines</h3>

  * Headings and labels should be as succinct as possible, ideally 10 characters
  or less. Do not use colon (:) or other punctuation after the header.

  * Help text in text fields should be 40 characters or less.

  Answer options beneath heading should also be succinct, roughly 25 characters
  or less.

  * Headings and answer options should be sentence case (unless specifically
  proper nouns or titles)

  * Notification messaging sits below filter and above results

  * Maximum three column wide layout, options stack vertically below 601 pixels

  * Follow form patterns for grouping, layout, and messaging.


  <h3>Behavior</h3>


  Filters live in an expandable style element allowing controls to be hidden
  when not in use/needed.


  On page load, the filter is collapsed by default. After filter is applied it
  remains open, except for mobile breakpoint (< 601 px) where is is collapsed
  after filtering to make vertical space for the notification to be viewed on
  screen.


  When a user applies a filter setting, a notification automatically appears
  below the panel indicating number of results or errors.
