[Follow these instructions in order to add a new page to the Design System](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/updating-this-website/#creating-new-pages).
Then, use this issue to track your work.
Remember, new standards should be discussed in Hubcap first before being added to the Design System. 

**What is the standard you're documenting?** 

**What section will it live in?** 


When you're ready to share a draft of the page, or want to raise questions, use this issue to track the discussion.
