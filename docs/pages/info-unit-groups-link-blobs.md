          The 25/75 image and text component is used to draw the userâ€™s eye to
          key information and navigation links, and aid comprehension by pairing
          content with illustration/imagery.


          When used in conjunction with 50/50 text components, it can help create a hierarchy of child pages or other content on the page, or can help feature a particular link over others.


          The 25/75 image and text component is the only format where the format name, 25/75, refers to how each individual unit it laid out, not to how multiple units are laid out.

          The 50/50 info unit is used to call attention to linked content on a
          page. At larger breakpoints, this component has a two column layout to
          utilize extra screen real estate.

description: "Info unit groups are generally used to provide brief context as
  they lead users from a parent page ([landing
  pages](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/templates/landing-pages),
  [sublanding
  pages](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/templates/sublanding-pages), and
  [browse pages](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/templates/browse-pages))
  to additional content on a child or sibling page. Info units provide the
  ability to create content with multicolumn layouts. There are two types: image
  and text, or text only."
