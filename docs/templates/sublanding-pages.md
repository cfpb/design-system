  #### Use case


  ##### When to use


  * When creating a new topic area within one of the main navigation verticals.

  * Target user is primarily in an explore mindset, so the main content of this
  page should be focused on introducing them to the topic and directing them to
  the specific content that will meet their needs.


  ##### When other options are better

  * When page content includes multiple paragraphs of copy or more detailed
  definitions or explanations.

  * When the desired user interaction is more geared toward encouraging users to
  sit down and read something or engage deeply with an interactive tool.


  #### Content guidelines

  * The content components should work together to create an overview of the
  information held within the section and how it relates back to the main
  navigation section.

  * Should be written and organized in a way that aids the user in skimming and
  quickly navigating to lower-level pages where they’ll find the information
  they need.

  * Components should work together to give users clear next steps and calls to
  actions; give them the opportunity to decide quickly what content is relevant
  to them and where they should go next.

  * The default placement for contact information should be in the sidebar. Only
  use the main content area when contact information is of extra significance or
  directly ties into the main objective of the page.

  * Page titles are sentence case and use the word “and” instead of “&”. (Note
  that navigation labels follows a different style.)

  * While full width body copy (including bulleted lists) is an option in this
  template, it should be used sparingly.


  ##### Area 1: Introduction

  * Choose between a hero or text introduction for this area.

  * Option for using breakout sidebar variation of the text introduction.

  ##### Area 2: Main content

  * Must contain at least 1 component, though the featured content module or
  gray well should not stand on their own.

  * Recommended hierarchy of components: featured content module, image & text
  components, gray well and half width link blobs, full width text, and contact
  information.

  * Gray well component should not be used at the top of this area if the
  introduction area contains a hero.

  ##### Area 3: Sidebar

  * Must contain at least 1 component.

  * If using both static and dynamic content, preference for dynamic content to
  appear above static content.



  #### Behavior


  Below the 901 px breakpoint, the sidebar stacks below the main content area.


  ##### Breakpoints 901+
