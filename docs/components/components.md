  <p class="lead-paragraph">Components are individual elements that can be used
  to create a webpage. A few examples include buttons, text inputs, tables, and
  alerts.</p>


  The Design System provides design specifications, code snippets, usage
  guidelines, and where possible, accessibility and research guidelines. 


  ## Status


  Unless otherwise noted, all components are released, stable, and ready for
  use. 


  Beta components are new and design changes may still occur. Please [contact
  us](tech@cfpb.gov) with any questions.


  ## Help us improve this documentation


  Generally, we feel our components are stable and ready for use, but we can use
  help improving this documentation. We've indicated the type of help we'd like
  and where conflicts in the current documentation exist. See how to get started
  [updating this
  documentation](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/getting-started/updating-this-documentation).
