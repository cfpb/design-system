  ### Content guidelines


  * Content in info units should be succinct. Do not use info units for multiple paragraphs of copy. 

  * In addition to giving each info unit a heading and description, you may optionally give the info unit group a heading and introductory paragraph. 

  * Each info unit type may use an H2, H3, or H4 depending on where the info unit sits within the page's heading hierarchy. 


  #### 25/75 info unit


  * Heading: Maximum 60 characters 

  * Description: Maximum 275 characters 

  * Call to action: Maximum 65 characters


  #### 50/50 info unit


  Ideally, use an even number of 50/50 info units as a group. The content in each info unit should be roughly the same number of lines if possible. 


  * Heading: Maximum 30 characters

  * Description

    * If including an image, minimum 50 characters and maximum 130 characters
    * If not including an image, minimum 100 characters and maximum 250 characters
  * Call to action: Maximum 40 characters


  #### 33/33/33 info unit


  Ideally, group 33/33/33 info units in multiples of three. The content in each info unit should be roughly the same number of lines if possible. 


  * Heading: Maximum 30 characters

  * Description: Minimum 90 characters and maximum 150 characters

  * Call to action: Maximum 30 characters


  ### Image guidelines


  Images can be illustrations or photos. 


  #### 25/75 info unit


  * Image required

  * 1:1 ratio size

    * Export the image at a 300px width to display well on retina screens. It will appear as 150px wide at a large browser width and automatically resize to 130px wide at a small browser width. 
  * Can be a square or circle crop


  #### 50/50 info unit


  * Image optional

  * 16:9 or 1:1 ratio size

    * For 16:9, export the image at a 1076px width by 606px height to display well on retina screens. It will appear at a 538px width by 303px height.
    * For 1:1, export the image at a 300px width to display well on retina screens. It will appear as 150px wide at a large browser width and automatically resize to 130px wide at a small browser width. The image can be a square or circle crop.

  #### 33/33/33 info unit


  * Image optional

  * 1:1 ratio size

    * Export the image at a 300px width to display well on retina screens. It will appear as 150px wide at a large browser width and automatically resize to 130px wide at a small browser width. 
  * Can be a square or circle crop


  ### Stylistic guidelines


  * Option to include a rule above an info unit group to separate it from the previous section on the page

  * Option to include a rule between rows of info units (or between each info unit in the case of the 25/75 info unit)

  * If an info unit group contains both an image and a call-to-action link, option to make the image link to the call-to-action URL. If there are multiple call-to-action links, the image will link to the first link.

  call-to-action link to lead a user to additional content on a child or sibling
  page. '
use_cases: >-
  ### When to use

  - To visually call out succinct information and a call-to-action link that leads users to a deeper dive into content

  - To help establish a hierarchy of linked content on a page


  ### When other options are better

  - When presenting multiple paragraphs of content
behavior: 'All info units stack to one column at small screen size. '
