          ### One-color seal


          For the rare case that the seal is on a material not being printed in full color, the one-color seal in black should be used. The one-color seal should always be placed on a white background.


          </div>

          </div>
use_cases: >-
  Use of the seal is very limited. It should never be used on consumer-facing
  materials, as it is important that the CFPB logo is consistently used to help
  consumers recognize and trust the CFPB. 


  The seal is used on a limited set of materials regarding enforcement, governmental affairs and official items from the Director’s office. These materials are limited to:


  * Official correspondence from the Director

  * Event materials where the Director’s office is the primary participant (e.g., podium placards and signage)

  * Statutorily required reports

  * Examiner commissioning certificates

  * Legal actions

  * Office of Administrative Adjudication official documents

  * PIV cards

  * Bureau flag

  * Employee awards, commendations, and certificates from the Director

  * Delegations of Authority from the Director

  ### Clear space


  Use ample space around the seal to ensure maximum impact and keep the mark from looking cluttered. The clear space on each side of the seal should be ¼” of the seal’s size.

  </div>


  <div class="content-33 content-first" markdown="1">


  ### Scale


  Use the seal at its benchmark size of 1.75” for most materials, such as a report cover. For materials such as signage and flags where the seal needs to appear larger, increase the seal's size in increments of 0.5”.

  </div>


  <div class="content-33 content-first" markdown="1">


  ### Background


  Place the seal on a white background. The only other color the seal may be placed on is navy, and this is reserved for select cases, such as the CFPB's flag.
