  ## Working together


  [Identify lived experiences and
  biases](#identify-lived-experiences-and-biases)


  Investigate internalized oppression


  Use bias-free, person-centered language


  Establish team values


  Assemble diverse teams


  ### Identify lived experiences and biases


  Bias is the tendency to allow personal opinions and past experiences to
  influence one’s judgment. Many of these biases may be unconscious, but they
  are none the less damaging to others. They are often based on false
  stereotypes about a particular group. It’s part of the human condition to rely
  on these cognitive shortcuts and to assume others think like us or have
  similar values, opinions, and beliefs.\ 


  Bias can skew our research and design activities, whether in our choice of
  who participates, what information is collected, or how information is
  interpreted. Awareness of our biases is key to mitigating against them, and
  that’s where the frames of reference exercise can be particularly valuable.

  <h2>Frames of reference</h2>


  *Adapted from 18F’s [presentation on equity-centered design and
  research](https://digital.gov/files/equity-centered-design-revised.pptx)*


  As a team, run through this activity to identify your individual and
  collective biases before beginning research or design activities. If possible,
  couple the exercise with a review of what you have learned about the audience.
  \ 


  Everyone should choose how they want to participate, but ideally this can be
  a group activity.


  <b>1. Ahead of the activity, add the following prompts to an online
  collaboration tool set to private mode (or a setting that allows for anonymous
  contribution).</b> Organize the prompts so all participants have enough room
  to add their responses. (More prompts can be found in 18F’s [frames of
  reference
  form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScI0iTQEstjECMzFVuyMt0Giku69Yg\
  gEkAlybQPlH4y7Ik9Vg/viewform).)\ 


  <div class=\"content-50 content-first\" markdown=\"1\">


  * Types of locations where you’ve lived (e.g. urban, rural)

  * Typical internet speed (high speed, cellular only)

  * Typical equipment used to access the internet (desktop or laptop computer,
  or mobile device only)\ 

  * Race & ethnicity\ 

  * Gender & sexual identity\ 

  * Age\ 

  * Food insecurity\ 

  * Housing insecurity\ 

  </div>


  <div class=\"content-50 content-last\" markdown=\"1\">\ 


  * Immigration status, or whether you’ve ever lived with an immigrant\ 

  * Languages spoken \ 

  * Familiarity with physical & mental disabilities \ 

  * Use of assistive technologies\ 

  * Marital and parental status\ 

  * Where you grew up\ 

  * Your values\ 

  * Your organization’s values  \ 


  </div>


  <b>2. During the collaboration session, ask the team to spend a few minutes
  privately noting their own personal, lived experiences in response to each of
  these prompts.</b>


  <b>3﻿. If the team wants to share their findings: </b>


  * Ask participants to add their findings anonymously to the collaboration
  tool. Emphasize that participants should choose how they wish to participate
  in this activity.\r


  * As a team, gather and organize the anonymized responses. Group them and
  identify themes. Ask participants what they noticed as they were doing this
  exercise. Was anything missing? Was anything surprising? For example, if
  everyone on the team lives in an urban environment, this exercise can help
  prompt awareness and discussion of the needs of people living in more rural
  areas. \r


  <b>I﻿f the team wants to keep their findings private:</b>


  * … and this is a new team: Discuss the prompts at a higher level, perhaps
  focusing on the agency mission and possible gaps in the team’s lived
  experience. For example, the team could spend more time drawing attention to
  gaps in internet speed and equipment, food and housing insecurity, and/or the
  needs of people with disabilities.\ 


  \r

  * … and the team is doing this exercise when beginning a project: Use a
  project-focused lens to run this exercise and discuss the prompts at a higher
  level. \r


  \  * What biases could come into play in this particular project?\r\ 


  \  * Do any of us have any lived experience that would help us in planning
  this project?\r

  d-decolonizing-design/) is another form of the Frames of Reference exercise.\ 


  * The Decision Lab has a [list of the most relevant cognitive biases in
  behavioral economics](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases), which can be applied
  to our own biases as designers and researchers, but also participants.\ 


  * Nielsen Norman Group has several resources pertaining to bias in UX. Watch
  their video, [Decision Biases Affecting UX
  Practitioners](]\r(https://www.nngroup.com/videos/decision-biases-ux-practiti\
  oners/)), to learn how to mitigate your own biases. \
