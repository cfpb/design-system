Before writing a list, it’s important to identify the best style needed for the information being presented.\n\nList items should:\n\n* Be capitalized\n* Avoid unnecessary repetition\n* Have a parallel structure\n* Start with an introductory clause or sentence\n* Use consistent punctuation\n\nIf the list items are complete sentences, the introductory clause should also be a complete sentence, followed by a colon. These list items should end with a period.\n\nIf the list items are a group of short fragments that each work to complete an introductory clause, the introductory clause should also be a short fragment, followed by a colon. These list items should end with no punctuation.\n\nMore information can be found at:\n* http://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/brand-guidelines/typography.html\t\n* https://cfpb.github.io/capital-framework/components/cf-typography/#lists","objects":{"entry":{"path":"docs/components/lists.md","sha":"f0c13a440bef9e7e4ca33e33143ba0119368c7e8"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2019-08-22T21:29:57.961Z"}
