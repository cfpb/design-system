  ## About the CFPB Design System


  Our design system has been created to work with a wide range of devices and browsers. Following a modern, mobile first responsive approach, sites built with our Design System easily adapt to a wide range of screen sizes, all while carefully following accessibility best practices.

  As a work of the United States government, all code is open source and in the public domain. We encourage you to use this framework in your own projects and to contribute back.
