  ## Working together


  ### Identify lived experiences and biases


  Bias is the tendency to allow personal opinions and experiences to influence one’s judgment. It’s part of the human condition to rely on these cognitive shortcuts and to assume others think like us or have similar values, opinions, and beliefs. Bias can skew our research and design activities, whether in our choice of who participates, what information is collected, or how information is interpreted. Awareness of our biases is key to mitigating against them, and that’s where the frames of reference exercise can be particularly valuable.

  <h3>Frames of reference</h3>


  <p> As a team, run through this activity to identify your individual and collective biases before beginning research or design activities. If possible, couple the exercise with a review of what you have learned about the audience.</p>
