description: The text introduction is the standard page introduction pattern
  used across all pages that do not have a
  [hero](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/components/heroes) or [item
  introduction]((https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/components/item-introduction).
  On [landing](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/templates/landing-pages) or
  [sub-landing
  pages](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/templates/sublanding-pages), the
  text introduction may be accompanied by a breakout sidebar to highlight a
  specific piece of content from the section.

      Text introductions consist of a heading and lead paragraph. They should be
      used on every page, except in cases when a hero or item introduction is
      used.

  - variation_group_name: Text introduction with optional breakout sidebar
    variation_group_description: >-
      On landing or sub-landing pages, the text introduction may be accompanied
      by a breakout sidebar to highlight a specific piece of content from the
      section. The optional breakout sidebar should be used when a specific
      piece of content needs to be highlighted that is related to but not a
      continuation of content in the introduction. The breakout sidebar may
      contain a related posts element or imagery. An example of it appears on
      the [Rulemaking sub-landing
      page](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/policy-compliance/rulemaking/). 




      Layout as seen with a ‘breakout’ highlight in the right sidebar area:

use_cases: ""
content_guidelines: >-
  Headings should be as succinct as possible, ideally staying on a single line
  at max column width; 35 characters or less.


  Heading should be in sentence case


  Use the word “and” instead of “&”


  Lead paragraph beneath heading should also be succinct, roughly 1-3 sentences; 350 characters maximum. This paragraph should explain why the page exists (how does its content tie back to the CFPB mission?) and the value add to the user (what will they get out of the content on this page?).


  The optional description paragraph can be anywhere from 1-5 sentences–100-800 characters–depending on the needs of the page. If a breakout sidebar is being used, longer text may be appropriate to help match the text introduction length to the sidebar length. For emphasis, a call to action last sentence can be entered as its own paragraph underneath this lead paragraph, either linked to a url or not.


  The optional call to action link should be one line; about 40 characters or less. Link content should follow link guidelines.
