  Capital Framework provides a set of modular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript patterns
  that can be used both collectively and individually. There are several ways to
  integrate Capital Framework into your project:




  1. Using the generator


  2. Using Less


  3. Downloading the compiled CSS




  Our recommended workflow is to use the generator to scaffold out a new Capital
  Framework project. This allows you to pick and choose your modules as well as
  providing a solid front end build process.
